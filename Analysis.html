		A plethora of headlines quickly followed the conclusion of CBS's second quarter earnings call on August 2. 
		Coming in the wake of the <em>New Yorker</em> article detailing accusations of sexual misconduct by Leslie 
		Moonves, they fell into 2 broad categories: those who blamed CBS or Moonves for refusing to discuss 
		the harassment allegations during the call, and those who blamed the analysts for not bringing it 
		up. In other words, some publications held CBS responsible for addressing the issue (or lack thereof) while 
		others held the analysts responsible. CBS itself fell into the former category.<p>
			
		Who was right? First of all, keep in mind that Wall Street analysts are not journalists.
		Second, while it's true that none of the analysts asked any questions about the allegations, there's no reason 
		to believe such questions would have been answered anyway. At the beginning of the call, CBS head of 
		investor relations Adam Townsend said, "In light of pending litigation and other matters, and on the advice 
		of counsel, the scope of today’s call and any questions will be limited to the quarterly results of the company,” 
		meaning the accusations "would be off limits for questioning" (Wall Street Journal B1). Despite reporting on 
		Townsend's warning, some outlets — such as <em>The Atlantic</em> — still suggested that the analysts were at fault.
