<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>January 1, 1800. In the living room of the British
governor’s mansion in London, the British regional governor Lord Phillips
smoked a pipe. It was 2PM. Phillips was taking a half-hour break in his private
quarters before boarding a stagecoach to Edinburgh for a meeting with the
authorities of the region. Fifteen minutes later, after downing a pear and
several sips of wine, Phillips walked out the front door and stepped onto the
stagecoach, escorted by a dozen bodyguards armed with muskets, pistols and sabers.
The driver was about to close the door when a messenger arrived. “Governor
Phillips!” the panting aide cried. “The emperor has just been assassinated in
North America. Parliament is currently in the process of appointing a
successor, since there are no heirs by blood. As you are one of the most likely
to succeed the emperor, be prepared. You may be called to Berlin right after
returning from your Scottish journey.” Lord Phillips was taken aback, stunned
at the abrupt, unexpected message. He could hardly believe what he had just
heard. The 29-year old Emperor Edwards had just been killed? He had just been
crowned two years earlier upon the death of his father. Now, on a visit to
European Canada, Edwards was dead. He had been killed too young for any
offspring, as he had not yet married. In this type of situation, Parliament was
called upon to appoint a successor. The potential candidates permitted by law
were any Member of Parliament, a regional governor, any lieutenant regional
governor, or one of the three major generals in European high command. Although
it was possible, no lieutenant governor had ever been appointed, nor was this
an exception. The most prominent candidates in January of 1800 were the
Representative from Flanders and the governors of Prussia, Great Britain, and
Russia: Waller <span class=SpellE>Peetsen</span>, <span class=SpellE>Hibb</span>
Hoffman, Lord Phillips and <span class=SpellE>Gerppin</span> <span
class=SpellE>Sokolov</span> respectively. Phillips decided immediately to
postpone his Scottish trip and proceed directly to Berlin. He wished to deliver
a speech to Parliament to promote his campaign for the crown. The vote was
taking place on March 15<sup>th</sup>. He needed to move fast if he hoped to
receive the appointment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The young Emperor Edwards had been in Quebec, the
capital of European Canada on November 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1799. The region
encompassing all of Northern North America had been under European control
since 1765. However, that day, assassins hired by the native tribes to the
south who detested European colonization of their lands were active in the
capital city. One 20-year old recruit named <span class=SpellE>Izzew</span> was
among the crowds overflowing the streets that day as Emperor Edwards paraded
through at a slow pace. The monarch waved to his fans and carried a joyful
expression. He had just finished an inspection of the troops and was now greeting
the populace on his way to his hotel. Three days later Edwards was scheduled to
board a ship returning to Europe. But the young emperor was to never see his
homeland again. As Edwards, mounted on his horse, galloped past <span
class=SpellE>Izzew</span>, the assassin, seeing his chance, pulled out a pistol
and fired straight at the European ruler’s chest. The first shot missed,
striking Edwards’ arm instead. But then <span class=SpellE>Izzew</span> fired
another pistol and the round this time was fatal. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Edwards fell off his mount with blood flowing
from his right arm and abdomen while his bodyguards tackled the assassin. The
Emperor was quickly rushed to the hospital, but before he even reached the
building it was clear that he was dead, killed instantly by the bullet that passed
straight through his heart. <span class=SpellE>Izzew</span>, meanwhile, was put
on trial for the assassination of Emperor Edwards and found guilty by a
unanimous vote. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The slaying of the European monarch was to have
far-reaching consequences beyond the appointment of a new emperor and the death
of the previous. The North American native tribes who lived in modern-day USA
and Mexico had united under one flag in 1760 under the singular goal of forcing
out the European settlers. Canada had been lost, but the natives were
determined not to relinquish any more. Their nation was dubbed the Dakota
Confederacy by the Europeans due to the fact that their capital was in the
Dakota region and their first chief was from there. The incumbent native chief
was Blue Potato. An aggressive veteran campaigner, he was the third chief of
the native tribes and had served in the ranks in all conflicts with the
Europeans since 1772. At age 61, his old fighting spirit had not been put down.
It was he who had opted to hire assassins to take out Emperor Edwards. Not
surprisingly, the European ambassador to the native tribes, John Sterling,
requested a meeting with him on December 1<sup>st</sup>. The native ambassador,

candidates, Hoffman and <span class=SpellE>Sokolov</span>, had many differences
with the British governor. Hoffman, however, posed hardly a challenge, since he
ran only a low-level campaign in just his own province and Poland due to a lack
of funds. Only <span class=SpellE>Sokolov</span>, the Russian governor, was a
threat as he campaigned madly across Europe. By the start of <span class=GramE>March</span>
he had already made stops in Finland, Russia, Poland, France, Austria and

below on the first story. Hoffman had not bothered to attend, knowing he only
had a chance of winning his home region of Prussia. Finally, at 5:30PM, Prime

announced that the voting had finished and counting had commenced. A half-hour
later, after an official count and re-count, <span class=SpellE>Toth</span>
stepped onto the podium again and declared the winner. “I hereby decree that
Governor Lord Phillips of Great Britain is our new emperor of Europe!” bellowed
<span class=SpellE>Toth</span>. Phillips jumped in the air with joy and hugged

conceded the election to Phillips later that day, as did <span class=SpellE>Peetsen</span>.
Hoffman was waiting outside the Parliament building and happily greeted all
three candidates. He had indeed only secured the votes of the Prussian

invasion by the Europeans. Blue Potato had been expecting confrontation with <span

few decisive early victories which would convince other nations to join the war
against Europe. Africa, after all, also housed European colonies and had fought
many earlier wars against Europe. Their relations with the Europeans were no
better than that of the Native Americans. Blue Potato expected an attack by sea
against the East Coast, since Canada only had sufficient troops for
self-defense. At best <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> could hope to
coordinate an operation with the European commanders on the East Coast. To no
one’s surprise, Blue Potato received an ultimatum on March 17<sup>th</sup> from
<span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>:<span

reading the message, tore up the slip of paper. He would never answer <span

</span>Instead, he ordered his best generals, Bone Wrangler and Shark Bull to
lead their own separate armies of 120,000 each towards the East Coast and

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Governor Phillips had become Emperor Phillips
following an elaborate coronation ceremony on May 8<sup>th</sup>. His wife,
Sophia Meyer, became the new Empress. Phillips had announced in his campaign
speeches that he would work on behalf of the poor and downtrodden peasants. He
wished to create a larger middle class and smaller low and high classes. The
first step was to increase taxes on the rich by 15% and decrease taxes on the
impoverished by 15%. However, the incumbent justice minister refused to carry
out such an order. As a result, Phillips replaced him with, to everyone’s
surprise, <span class=SpellE>Gerppin</span> <span class=SpellE>Sokolov</span>,
the Russian governor. Phillips personally swore him into his new position on
May 20<sup>th</sup>. His main reason for doing so was to promote better
relations between the two men. He believed the Russian to be an energetic and
good-willed fellow, and thought he would serve as a fine gentleman in the
government, seeing how energetically he had campaigned for emperor.
Unfortunately, moments after the ceremony Phillips was whisked away to Paris to
discuss major developments in North America. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Blood Drawer, to attack Fort Toronto just north of Lake Ontario. Blood Drawer
had rowed an army of 80,000 men across the Great Lakes by cover of darkness on
the night of April 22<sup>nd</sup>. By 5AM the following morning, the fortress
was surrounded by Native American warriors. Upon hearing the good news that
Blood Drawer had fulfilled his task without being detected, Blue Potato himself
came to command the army personally. The chief arrived a month later on May 21<sup>st</sup>.
He immediately held a council of war outside his tent in the main camp. <span

300,000 troops are stationed either here or on the East coast. Reserves are
minimal and number around 20,000. I would suggest we capture Toronto as soon as
possible. Remember, Chief. Our goal is to score decisive victories over the
Europeans, convincing Africa to join our side. Keep that in mind.”<span

</span>“Hiawatha’s strategy certainly sounds reasonable. We could storm the
castle, in this case Fort Toronto, and secure the fortress. Our spies report
that it holds only 10,000 defenders in all, along with a mere 29 artillery
pieces. That would certainly strike fear into the hearts of the Canadians. It
would put them on alert. It would worry and demoralize <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>

currently sleeping, to join our side? And then run the Europeans out of
Canada?”<span

primary objective we base our plans on, Blood Drawer,” responded Blue Potato. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                            </span>“That’s
what I thought,” continued Blood Drawer. “But I see a problem. The Europeans will
arrive in force before long. That means thousands of troops, perhaps even as
high as 400,000 men. That’s well over our full military strength. Sure, the
Africans can support us. But they are just as far from our shores as the
Europeans are. They can’t possibly help us over here. Why, it’ll take them a
year or two just to push the Europeans out of their <span class=GramE>continent.</span>
That’s hard enough. I can’t imagine them being able to force the Europeans out
of ours.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                     
</span>“My dear general,” said Blue Potato calmly, “you are an upstart young
fellow. You have forgotten that the war is not restricted to this zone. Why,
the Africans can help us by opening a second front. And that means arousing a
conflict in the Mediterranean. That’ll keep the Europeans occupied and make
thing easier on our front. It’ll ease our forces and put strain on the
Europeans’. That shall help us far more than sending their men way over here.

‘retribution’. Well, I say, if they can use that, we can use that!
Governor-general <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> demands we send four armies
to make those native fools pay. I say, we send eight, no, ten armies and make
them pay even more! We are clearly the more civilized and advanced nation. I
was just told recently that Fort Toronto has fallen to the natives. They hold
thousands of our brothers and <span class=GramE>sisters</span> captive. If they
slaughter them, we will slaughter millions of theirs. We will punish the Dakota
Confederacy beyond anything it can dream up. If they burn our cities,
fortresses and churches to the ground, we will burn theirs to the point where
it will never burn again! I hereby ask you, members of Parliament, to declare a
state of war against the empire of Blue Potato and his evil supporters in the Dakota
Confederacy.” Ending his speech with a bow, Emperor Phillips walked off the
stage and boarded a stagecoach headed for Paris. Prime Minister <span
class=SpellE>Toth</span> immediately quieted the cheering and hollering
representatives and commenced voting. The following morning, <span
class=SpellE>Sokolov</span> himself stepped onto the podium and announced that
the result had been 992-7 in favor of war. One representative had not attended
the previous day’s session due to family-related issues. Waller <span
class=SpellE>Peetsen</span>, the representative from Flanders, immediately
demanded to know who had voted against a declaration of war. <span
class=SpellE>Sokolov</span> refused to say, strongly angering <span
class=SpellE>Peetsen</span> who requested over and over again. Eventually he
took off his shoe and was preparing to hurl it at the justice minister when two
Parliamentary guards tackled him. He was led out by three members of the
security forces. Prime Minister <span class=SpellE>Toth</span> stepped onto the
stage; <span class=SpellE>Sokolov</span>, taking the hint, promptly left the
building. <span class=SpellE>Toth</span> officially concluded the session of
Parliament and declared that “the Dakota Confederacy will be under our heel by
1802”. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Three weeks after the declaration of war against the
natives, Emperor Phillips arrived in Paris on July 22<sup>nd</sup> to discuss
strategy with the European high command. The three major generals at the time
were <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>, <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span> and
Weber, the third also being the governor of Austria. Phillips told his
commanders during the 3-hour conference that he wanted seven armies, in all
350,000 men, to be landed on the East Coast of North America, along with
cavalry and artillery supplements. Coordinating operations with General
Collingwood, the Canadian military chief, the European forces would attack the
natives from north and east. They would capture the capital of the Dakota
Confederacy, <span class=SpellE>Eropet</span>, in the Dakotas, and that would
deal a fatal blow leading to the eventual collapse of the nation with European
troops closing in. It looked like a brilliant plan on paper devised by Phillips
and presented to his commanders. The emperor chose for <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> to lead the massive force, which would be
split into two armies of 175,000. Weber had not been selected since a regional
governor could not be out of the continent for over six months at a time by
law. The formidable invasion force gathered on the coast of Spain over the
course of August, and on September 3<sup>rd</sup> it set sail aboard an
incredible armada of 1,700 ships for North America. The fleet was under the
command of European vice admiral Herbert Vincent. <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> were staying onboard the flagship <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Conquistador</i> with him. In addition to
the flagship, there were 52 other large warships escorting the 1,700
transports, along with 8 frigates. About half of the vessels belonged to the
British Royal Navy, 12 to the French and 18 to the Spanish. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=SpellE><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
was not feeling well. He had gotten enraged again upon hearing that Fort
Toronto had surrendered. His mood only worsened when Pierre told him about the
hostages. <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> had immediately ordered
Collingwood to lead two Prussian armies stationed in Canada against the
natives, but then a message from Phillips arrived. It told him to wait until a reinforcing
army of 350,000 arrived. When that happened, he would receive further
instruction. <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> relayed the order to
Collingwood. Pierre informed him several days later that the small town of
Hamilton had also been captured by Blood Drawer. It was too much for the
Canadian governor-general to sit back and have his commanders remain idle while
innocent civilians were being held captive and killed. On August 2<sup>nd</sup>,
he gave Collingwood the order to subdue this major threat to the peace and
stability of European Canada. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Hamilton had a population of approximately 9,000. Of
that number, 1,500 men between the ages of 20-55 belonged to the local militia.
However, they were caught completely off guard by Blood Drawer’s native
cavalry, which stormed into the village at 4AM on the morning of June 8<sup>th</sup>,
1800. Within an hour, 382 militiamen had been slaughtered. Their captain
surrendered the town around 6 to prevent further bloodshed. Blood Drawer
himself rode in at noon, inspecting the scene. The town was practically
untouched. He had lost 17 horsemen and another 29 were wounded. He immediately
sent a messenger to Blue Potato, still in Fort Toronto, to tell him the news. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>With Hamilton also taken, Blue Potato highly expected <span
class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> to send an army against him. His spies alerted him
on August 15<sup>th</sup> that a Prussian advance guard had been spotted 25
miles north of Fort Toronto. Unfortunately, the size of the enemy force
remained uncertain. Blue Potato decided that Blood Drawer could handle the
situation himself. He would merely supply him with an additional 20 pieces of
artillery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Collingwood was, unfortunately, an inexperienced
commander. He had decided to attack the natives rather than wait them out, as
he should have. Blood Drawer was waiting for him atop <span class=SpellE>Frankenheimer</span>
hill. The native commander had set up his headquarters atop the hill, along
with the 20 heavy guns had received: 10 9-pounders and 10 12-pounders.
Collingwood had with him no artillery, having been told by <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>
that the natives had hardly any and would not risk losing what little they
possessed so early in the campaign. The Dakota Confederacy did indeed have very
few artillery pieces; only 50 <span class=GramE>cannon</span> in all. They had
either been captured from the Europeans in earlier battles or gained from
trading with Dutch settlers before hostilities had ensued. But Blue Potato
staked 40% of it on this one battle. Not only did the natives hold few cannon,
they were in low supply of firearms as well. They could only field 22,000
troops armed with any type of gun. The rest had to make do with spears, swords,
axes and shields. Most of the ranged units still used either bows and arrows or
crossbows. The technological advantage was what gave the Europeans under Collingwood
a morale boost. Canada at this time could raise only a maximum of 150,000
troops, excluding militia. It was that way because <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>,
as well as the generals in European high command, believed this immense
difference in technology would make each European soldier equivalent to ten
natives. Therefore, there was no need for extra funds being spent on what
general <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span> called “petty fears”. The
Europeans would pay for this major mistake in the oncoming battle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Collingwood started off by sending his infantry, 20,000
musket-armed troops. They marched in columns across the open grassy plain and
were hit by continuous artillery barrages. Blood Drawer had positioned his men
just behind the hill, keeping them out of sight. Once the European infantry had
gotten within 500 feet of the hill, he sent them up at a charge. Collingwood’s
men were caught unawares and struggled to get into line. But before a shot
could be fired, the native warriors had made contact. Thousands of sabers,
swords, cutlasses, axes, spears, hatchets and clubs stabbed, jabbed, tore and
ripped at the flesh and body of the European troops. The muskets the Europeans carried
held bayonets, but they were ineffective compared to the close-combat weaponry
the natives used. Two hours later, after rough and bloody fighting, Collingwood’s
columns had routed and were in full retreat. The European commander threw in
the elite Prussian foot guard reserve of 5,000, as well as the cavalry, to save
the day, but they were similarly hit hard by Blood Drawer’s artillery. Blood
Drawer sent his own cavalry against the foot guards, who formed square and
repelled three charges. Eventually, the cannons ran out of ammunition. The European
cavalry had a close fight with the native infantry, but in the end the foot
guards routed and the battle was won for the natives. Blood Drawer’s cavalry
had suffered the heaviest losses: around 7,000 horsemen killed or wounded. The
combat infantry had lost 4,000 men. Collingwood retreated back to Fort Ottawa,
leaving 18,000 European dead on the field. 23,000 troops had been wounded. It
was a horrific defeat for the Europeans. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Blue Potato was ecstatic upon hearing of the decisive
victory scored by Blood Drawer. Immediately, he ordered the news relayed to
Africa. Unfortunately, dampening this report was a message from Bone Wrangler.
The European invasion force was bound to arrive within the next two weeks. The
Dakota Confederacy hardly possessed a navy. In 1800, it totaled 4 warships
stationed on the East Coast and 250 war canoes along with 10 frigates
positioned on the Great Lakes. The war canoes were tiny compared to the
gigantic ships-of-the-line the Europeans sailed. They could hold a maximum of
10 men and required paddling to move. Knowing that there was no chance of
stopping the European invasion fleet, Blue Potato ordered the navy to retreat
back to harbor. As it was already late September, the chief expected the
Europeans to try and defeat his army on land immediately, then make winter
quarters in preparation for intense fighting in the spring. Meanwhile, more
reinforcements would arrive through the established beachhead. This would tip
the scales against the natives, and eventually, attacked on two sides and with
overwhelming enemy numbers, Blue Potato would be crushed and forced to
surrender. To prevent this, the chief realized he had only one option: keep the
Europeans in the water. He must not allow them to establish a beachhead. In his
response to Bone Wrangler, Blue Potato urged his general to thoroughly fortify
the Atlantic waterfront. Not one enemy soldier should breach their defenses. <br

had lost two valuable, well-trained, well-equipped, irreplaceable Prussian
divisions. High command would be furious if they found out. The
governor-general knew that to salvage his reputation and prestige, he needed to
score a similar victory over Blue Potato. After hearing the horrific news on
the 20<sup>th</sup> of September, he had considered sacking Collingwood, but
there were no better European commanders in Canada, only ones of equal or
lesser competence. The best generals were either in Europe or on their way to
North America aboard the invasion armada. It would be at least another two
weeks before their arrival. In the meantime, with the capital of Quebec
threatened, <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> decided to call up the national
militia to defend the city. By September 25<sup>th</sup>, in addition to the
regular garrison of 15,000, thirty-thousand militia were raised from the
surrounding region and began training exercises. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Conquistador</i> spotted land at 4PM on
November 4<sup>th</sup>, 1800. After the admiral verified the claim, there were
mass celebrations aboard ship. The entire fleet was in a joyous state for the
whole of the evening. On the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Conquistador</i>,
barrels of beer and wine were rolled out and sailors drank to their heart’s
content. Humongous trays of splendid food were brought out, and dining went on
until nine that night. <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> and <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>,
the senior commanders aboard, although invited to the celebratory supper by
Admiral Vincent, did not attend. Instead a servant brought their dinner to them
and they ate in <span class=SpellE>Gummen’s</span> quarters while in deep
discussion over what they should do. After two hours of debate, the two
generals finally decided on waiting for reports from the lookout. <span

upon before knowing whether the natives had fortified the beach in advance, and
<span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> concurred. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>As the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Santa
Anna</i>, a 64-gun Spanish warship, neared the beach the following morning, 5
cannonballs hit it. One tore a hole in a sail while the others all smashed into
the hull and sides. Shark Bull’s naval artillery, only 5 16-pounders, had begun
firing. The first warships in line turned slowly into a horizontal formation.
The troops were loaded onto small boats holding between 20-40 men and then they
began rowing themselves in the direction of the beach. The warships, at a
signal from Admiral Vincent himself, unleashed a massive barrage against the
native defenses. 2 of the 5 heavy guns were silenced and 31 men killed. Ten
minutes later, the European gun crews fired again, and this time the 3
remaining cannons were knocked out. Now Shark Bull’s men cowered behind their
defenses, waiting for the order to attack. The first of the European infantry
touched land at 10AM. A minute after stepping onto the warm sand, the troops
witnessed a bewildering sight: thousands of arrows flying towards them in a
gigantic mass. Many of the Europeans turned to flee, but they could not outrun
the wave of projectiles hurtling at them. Hundreds of terrified men were either
killed instantly or maimed in a matter of seconds. <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>, watching the scene from the safety of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Conquistador</i>, realized that the
natives would only repeat the arrow showers over and over again. They needed a
different strategy if they hoped to overcome the defenses. “My fellow

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>At 30 minutes to one the following morning, the elite
Austrian <span class=SpellE>windbüchse</span> <span class=SpellE>jäger</span>
battalion moved out from their home ship, the British <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>HMS Britannia</i>. 15 minutes later, they were in firing position. Each
sniper was dressed in camouflage attire, and either kneeled down or crouched.
Their dark outfits, combined with the moonless night, had made them invisible
to the native sentries as they slowly, silently walked across the beach. Not a
sound was made as each man waited patiently for 1AM to roll around. At 12:55,
70 transport vessels beached themselves. They were all filled to the brim with
European infantrymen, preparing for to charge directly at the defenses as soon as
the sentries had been killed. At one o’clock sharp, the captain of the Austrian
<span class=SpellE>jägers</span> waved a white flag in the air for 4 seconds.
It was brief, and hardly distinguishable in the darkness, but his men detected
it immediately. They raised their weapons with expert preciseness, and fired
one accurate volley that took out the 20 sentries patrolling the triple-layer
defensive wall. Seeing the action, the troops waiting onboard the transport
ships quietly slipped out and began crawling their way towards the native
defenses. Unfortunately, the dead bodies on the ground alerted a native soldier
who had just started his night patrol shift; he immediately brought his fears
to the attention of Shark Bull, who commanded the section of the front. Shark
Bull sounded the alarm without delay. Just as the first wave of troops was
nearing the wall, the Dakota archers launched another shower of arrows. It
brought down 300 men in seconds. The initial line of Europeans was impressively
able to dash forwards and reach the wall, and was untouched by the arrow
shower. They began climbing the scaling ladders, but were engaged by native
spearmen. Ten minutes of rough combat left the natives victor. <span
class=SpellE>Gummen</span>, witnessing the failure from the deck of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Conquistador</i>, was thoroughly disappointed.
With the attack in shambles, there was nothing left to do but retreat. In all,
the two unsuccessful assaults had cost nearly 10,000 European dead or wounded.
It was a terrible price for virtually no gain. Shark Bull, on the other hand, was
satisfied. His army had repelled two large-scale European attacks while losing
just fewer than 200 troops. He sent a messenger with the superb report to the
chief. Perhaps Blue Potato might replace Blood Drawer with me as his
second-in-command after hearing this, he thought. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

stunned to read the latest news report from North America. Although the
information was over a month old, it was enough for the aging monarch to see
that the Dakota Confederacy was a formidable foe against the long-powerful and
dominant European empire. He wondered whether he should allow his nation to
join the conflict. He was on decent terms with the Europeans. In exchange for
letting Africa remain as an independent nation, the Europeans had captured
Egypt. It was now considered an official province, with its own governor,
although it had only one representative in parliament due to its nevertheless
low population. The official adjustment of Egypt from a European colony (with a
governor-general) to a regional province (with a regional governor) had been
declared recently, in 1798 after a spectacular naval victory against the
Africans in the battle of the Nile. In October of that year, Africa had signed
a peace treaty, with granted the Europeans Egypt. Peace had ensued ever since. But
due to the short timespan between then and now, <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span>
II was still maintaining large numbers of spies in the province. The European
troops numbers there were high, and there was a constant police presence, but
not a lot of attention had yet been put towards eliminating enemy agents. As a
result, <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span> knew very well what was going on in the

North America. But how, he wondered? “Blood Drawer, I’m going to require your
assistance on this one. Please give me anything you’ve got on your mind. I,
quite frankly, am clean out of ideas.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                         </span>“I would wait for the
moment, chief. Quebec is guarded by at least 20,000 troops. We will not be able
to take it through a siege. Plus, the forces that failed to attack us on the
beach are reportedly heading to Quebec for the winter. For the time being, we
can only wait for warmer weather. Once that arrives, however, I still do not
recommend attacking the city. It is too well defended. Our army in Canada is
not that strong or large. In fact, sir, I suggest that we bring some troops
over here from the East Coast. We need extra men here as opposed to there. No doubt
the Europeans have learned that an amphibious assault is not the best method.
They won’t attempt there again for some time,” responded Blood Drawer. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                        </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                </span>“In
that case, I’ll have Bone Wrangler bring his entire army. We will give
Collingwood a surprise when he attacks us again in the spring. But, my friend,
what shall we do during this cold season?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                        
</span>“Following my judgment, I’d say we should recruit some more men for our
armies. Hopefully this next report will bring <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span>
to our side. Surely that’ll force Phillips to call some divisions over there,
and lessen the European strength here.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                                         
</span>“Good thinking,” said Blue Potato. “Bone Wrangler’s army will help our
forces in Canada quite a bit. My only concern is that he will lose several
dozens of men to the freezing winter.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                       </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                    </span>“I’m afraid
there is little we can do about that, chief, but tell him to bundle out tight,”
replied Blood Drawer. <span

right away with his army,” said the chief. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

of his best generals had been wholly unable to break the beach defenses. They

"Times New Roman",serif'>On January 22<sup>nd</sup>, King <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span>
II learned that the European forces under <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span> had retreated. The natives had proven themselves
quite able of standing up to and even repelling repeatedly the once-invincible
European military. This was the first time the Europeans had lost a major
battle in over three decades, and if they lost this war, it would be their
first since 1521, when they had been crushed by the might of the Asians and
forced to sign a peace treaty. He was still, however, not fully ready to launch
himself and his country into a full-scale war against the Europeans. His mind
was changed after hearing that the Europeans had begun investigating into his
spy network in Egypt. It was too late to dismantle, and if Phillips figured out
the scale of the operation, he would start a conflict anyway. That finally
convinced <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span> to inform his commanders that he was
planning to start a revolt in Egypt on April 30<sup>th</sup>. His agents would
secretly arm the native peoples still loyal to the Africans, and then, at a
signal, the entire populace would revolt. The Europeans would be forced to
bring troops back from North America to combat the threat. There was only one
last step left. The king was interested in the reward he would receive from the
Dakota Confederacy once the war was won for his immense assistance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>There was a lot of disappointment circulating in
Europe’s high offices. Governor-general <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> was
not happy to see over 300,000 troops arrive at Quebec’s doorstep on January 12<sup>th</sup>.
<span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> explained the terrible situation to him.
“Governor-general, you see, we lost around 35,000 men on the way here from
cold, disease and lack of sufficient feeding. Our food supplies are low. We are
suffering from the horrific temperatures in these parts. Would you be willing
to provide winter quarters for our needy army, which is in such poor
shape?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                        
</span>“See here, pal,” responded <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>, “this
city, large as it is, can’t house 300 thousand men for 2 months. At best, the
hotels, barracks and willing residential homes can hold about 120,000 on such
short notice. Plus, you’ll need to pay a huge fee, which I can’t even
imagine—”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

worry about the fee. We can cover that. But what you just stated is not even
enough for half our force. Where can the rest of the men stay? We are not going
to allow them to just die in this region. They’re required for the spring
campaign.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                                      
</span>“You can bring them another 30 miles southwest to Montréal. That city,
I’m quite sure, can hold the remaining troops. If that doesn’t work, then just
send them to Fort Ottawa. Now, let’s see…the cost of all those rooms…food…2
months’ worth…I estimate about £15,000,000, but for some of the <span
class=SpellE>residentials</span> you’ll need to check with the homeowner,”
stated <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                                           </span>“Sounds
about right to me. Well, I’ll be seeing you now, Governor-general.” With that, <span
class=SpellE>Gummen</span> signaled to his officers, and the army began
marching into the Canadian capital. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The winter came and went in a breeze. On the native
side, Blood Drawer delivered a powerful 20-minute speech on the steps of Fort
Toronto on January 3<sup>rd</sup> to bring in new, patriotic, dedicated
recruits to the cause. It did the trick, and by the start of March, 40,000 more
men had signed up for military duty. The Europeans, on the other hand, had
achieved little. 12 African agents had been captured and interrogated by <span
class=SpellE>Attard’s</span> men. Four admitted to a planned revolt sometime in
the near future. Just in case, Weber had instructed <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> to send 30,000 troops back to the homeland
in the event of a real emergency. In the meantime, to quell the potential of
such an uprising, Phillips called in the European ambassador to Africa, Jacob
Lukas. “Ambassador, tell King <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span> II that if such a
riot does not succeed, his nation will be so thoroughly leveled it shall never
rise again.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>On March 11<sup>th</sup>, 1801, General <span
class=SpellE>Gummen</span> announced at the weekly 10AM Sunday briefing that
the temperature had improved sufficiently for wartime operations to resume. The
weather was clear with a pure blue sky and few clouds. Ten days later, he and <span
class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span> had successfully gathered their men outside Fort
Ottawa, and the troops were ready to march against native-held Fort Toronto. The
army was split into two halves of approximately 150,000, commanded by <span
class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span> and <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>. But just
three hours after the force departed the base, a messenger came galloping on
his horse. “General <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>! General <span
class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>! A note has arrived from European high command
in Paris. They need you to send 50,000 men back to Europe! They are suspecting
an African revolt and need your men to reinforce the army in Egypt and Turkey.”<span

</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                     </span>“Oh.
Well, in that case, we shall have to reorganize. <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>,
halt!” ordered <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>. “We need to split again,
into two groups of 125,000. The remaining men, you go with Collingwood back to
Quebec. From there, the navy will transport you to Europe to fight the Africans
in North Africa.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                              
</span>“Yes,” responded <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>. “But won’t this delay
our maneuver? If we wait, the natives’ scouts will spot us. They may prepare an
ambush if given the time. Their men no doubt will see us easily; such a
gigantic mass of moving bodies. To prevent that, we’d have to march all the way
back to Ottawa.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                   </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                            </span>“And
that we shall. There’s hardly any space out here to reorganize anyhow. There’s
only enough room for two marching columns of 5 men abreast. I know you’ll
complain that we’ll lose four days because of this, but I’m afraid it’s
necessary. We’ve already failed two missions. We can’t fail another one or
Phillips will have us sacked.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span><span

brother, I’m afraid you’re right.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Just as <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> had feared, Blood
Drawer’s scouts neared in on Fort Ottawa on March 24<sup>th</sup> and saw the
European army on the move along the road to Fort Toronto. The scouts, riding on
light and nimble horses, raced back ahead of the European army and informed
Blood Drawer about the approaching enemy force. He decided he would prepare an
ambush in the surrounding woodland. Wooden representations of native sentries
would be placed on the walls of the fortress to deceive the Europeans into
believing the fort was manned. The native scouts watched the road closely on
horseback ten miles ahead of the fort, ready to alert Blood Drawer should the
Europeans arrive. Around noon on April 1<sup>st</sup>, 1801, General <span
class=SpellE>Bellefleur’s</span> advance guard troops had Fort Toronto in their
sight. Native scouts nearby, who quickly galloped away on their horses, saw
them. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>They reported to Blood Drawer, who
ordered his men into their ambush positions on both sides of the road. A half
hour later, the two European columns were just outside Fort Toronto. General <span
class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>, at the head of the line, surrounded by twenty
bodyguards, yelled at the “sentries” atop the walls. “Excuse me! These are the
European forces. Surrender now and you will be treaty humanely. Do otherwise,
and you will face an untimely, gruesome death. The choice is yours. You have an
hour.” <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                               </span>“We will never
give in to you, bloodthirsty bastards!” cried Blood Drawer. At the signal, ten
artillery pieces fired from the wall. The columns were hit hard and lost 40 men
in an instant. Seconds afterwards, 60,000 native troops, wielding axes, swords
and clubs, jumped out of the trees and threw themselves directly at the
columns. The Europeans, taken by surprise, struggled to fight back with
bayonet-tipped muskets, daggers and sabers. Blood Drawer’s native cavalry
charged straight for <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>. He tried desperately
to make his way back down the road, but the columns had been disorganized and
turned into a giant mass at the front, which he could pass through. The
cavalry, thousands strong, quickly defeated <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur’s</span>
bodyguards. The general himself pleaded for mercy, but had his head taken off
by a single ax blow. European morale collapsed upon seeing this, but native
warriors surrounded the mass on all sides and no one could escape. A small group
of elite grenadiers managed to breach in a corner sector and make good their
getaway, but they were the only survivors of the massacre. By 3PM, the horde
had been slaughtered, and nearly 90,000 European troops lay dead on the road. Further
down the line, General <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> had been puzzled as to
why the columns had stopped moving. He was not informed of the ambush until
1:30, but upon hearing the disastrous news he immediately ordered a general
retreat back to Fort Ottawa. It was a wise move and saved 200,000 men. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

which his family had been preparing for generations. The recipe was a closely
guarded secret. He used only a handful of ingredients: onions, carrots, green
beans, potatoes, tomatoes, asparagus tips, corn, squash, along with olive oil
and seasoning. The only problem was, the best olive oils originated from
Europe. As a result, from the start of 1801 Buffalo Rider had had to resort to
using a lower quality vegetable oil imported from Africa. “Blood Drawer, I’m
afraid that we’ll have to make do with a lesser soup. Buffalo Rider’s usual
isn’t up to its typical standards due to a shortage of olive oil. The producers
of that won’t trade with us cause we’re at war.” <span

But we will be thoroughly prepared next time. We have attacked three times and
lost. What can we learn from this? Would you happen to know Charles Collingwood,
<span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>? He’s the commander of Canadian armed forces.
Would you happen to know his predecessor?” <span class=SpellE>Gummen’s</span>
only reply was a loud sob. “I take it you don’t. Well, he was the legendary
François Durand. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Durand was the first Canadian
military head, from 1765 to 1797. That’s over 3 decades, <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>.
How did he become a legend? He believed that sound discipline; intensive
training, realistic planning and well-thought strategy could defeat any enemy.
He thought those four aspects were far more important than numbers. He
implemented them into his battalion at the start of the European-Dakota war in
1752, and his unit soon became the most prominent in all of the European army. He
was rapidly promoted from corporal to Sergeant to officer, then captain, then
colonel, then major and finally a field marshal. At the conclusion of the war
in 1764, then-Emperor Lord Aqualon personally traveled to Canada and in an
elaborate ceremony promoted Durand to head of the Canadian armed forces in
February of 1765. He stayed in that position until his death. Collingwood, the
vice commander-in-chief, took over afterwards. <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>,
do you know why I’m telling you this?” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                  </span>“No, sir,”
replied <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>. At that moment, Pierre came out of
the kitchen and served to <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> their meals. “Enjoy your lunch,” said Pierre as he
left the room. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                             </span>“Bernard,”
called <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>. “Make sure to have the coach ready
for my transfer back to the mansion. Anyways, <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>,
I’m explaining the story of Durand because he truly was a great general.
Although he served as the head of the Canadian military from 1765 to 1797, he
did practically all of his impressive feats before that period or during the
first five years. The remainder was peacetime in which he mostly just conducted
inspections, promoted the best, and did desk work. However, he was the man who
takes the most responsibility for forcing the natives out of Canada and firmly
establishing our colonies here. What I recommend for you to do is follow his
principles and guidelines. I can guarantee that your performance will improve.
Don’t worry, I’ll write Phillips a letter describing your heroic leadership at
the Fort Toronto massacre so he doesn’t fire you. That way, if you continue to
fail, I shall receive the blame.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                               
</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                    </span>“Gee,
thanks, Governor-general. I really appreciate the assistance. But how do I
learn the ways of Durand? And why you are bestowing such a great opportunity
upon me?” asked a puzzled <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>            </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                 </span>“You
are the only Frenchman left in high command. Well, you’re not actually a
Frenchman, you’re a Belgian, but there’s hardly a difference with you. I don’t
want to have to deal with those British, Austrian, Spanish or German pests.
They’re quite a nuisance, always acting as lackeys of the emperor and never
independently thinking. I simply can’t stand them. The fact that I can’t
understand them either doesn’t help. It’s clear that Phillips will be
appointing anyone but a Frenchman to replace <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>.
You’re the only one left I can trust. As for your learning, Durand wrote a book
on his experiences called <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>My Canadian
Journey</i>. It details how he fought the natives and brought European Canada
into existence. There are quite a few lessons in teaches in there.” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                      </span>“Are
you saying you have a copy, Governor-general?”<span

</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                        </span>“I
actually three, but I am giving one to you,” said <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>
as he reached under the table and pulled out a new hardcover version. “Here, <span
class=SpellE>Gummen</span>. This will be one of the key components of your
success. By the way, don’t abuse your safety net. I’m giving you protection,
but I’m not looking to have my reputation and prestige soiled. If you are
unable to get back up on your feet after some time, I will personally travel to
Berlin and ask that Phillips remove you from command.” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                  </span>“You
can count on me, Governor-general. I am very grateful for what you are
entrusting in me.” <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> finished his meal and
downed the remaining half-glass of wine. “Thank you. I’ll be leaving now.” The
commander stood up, grabbed the book, saluted <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>
and walked out of the room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>“</span>Frey, I would fire you right now,”
interrupted Phillips, “but I received a letter from Governor-general <span

the battlefield and saved the army from suffering further casualties. Is what
I’m describing correct, in your opinion?” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                     </span>“Well,
I wouldn’t talk it all up like that, but yes; I did conduct a retreating

I am not. You shall retain your position, thanks to the kindness of Girard de <span
class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>. However, if this happens again on such a scale,
you can expect the worst. Anyhow, I will need your and Alexander’s advice on
who to replace <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>. My current candidates from
the general’s staff are <span class=SpellE>Dimitrios</span> <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>,
a Greek, Matteo Russo, an Italian, and Maxim Ivanov, a Russian. Alexander
suggests Ivanov. What do you think, Frey?” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                       </span>“Well,”
began <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>, “I personally don’t know these men very
well. I have not collaborated with any of them. Who has the best abilities,
Emperor?” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                      </span>“They
all have relatively equal abilities. That’s why I need you and Alexander’s help
to decide.” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                     </span>“I
would go with Ivanov. He was a close advisor to <span class=SpellE>Bellefleur</span>.
He proved a remarkable captain in his 4<sup>th</sup> division.” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>           </span>“I see. In that case, Ivanov it is.
Now, Frey, I’m giving you a new command in Africa. You have a hard task ahead
of you. You need to lead the Egyptian expeditionary force of 75,000. King <span
class=SpellE>Ubinu</span> has seized Cairo. The slaves and African natives of
the region have risen up in revolt. I want you to quell the uprising and bring
Egypt back under our control. Do you think you can manage that, Frey?” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                 </span>“Yes,
sir. I most certainly can. But who will be in charge of our forces in Canada?”<span

</span>“Due to this sudden, unexpected threat in Africa, we have to split our
army into two. <span class=GramE>Thus</span> we are forced to develop a defensive
policy in Canada. Seems fitting too, given every attempt at attack has failed
against the natives. Ivanov will be commanding the army there. Alexander will
be, as usual, the general in charge of our home army due to legal complications
arising from his being a governor. Any further questions, Frey?” asked
Phillips. <span

will be stationed in Alexandria, correct, Emperor?”<span

</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                              </span>“Actually, it’s
too risky for you to use that as headquarters. Instead, your HQ will be
Nicosia, Cyprus, about 330 miles north of Alexandria, which will one, be
protected by the navy and coastal batteries, and two, safer by being more
distant from the front. You leave on August 15<sup>th</sup> from Athens<span

</span>“I gave Alexander that decision, and he chose <span class=SpellE>Dimitrios</span>,
that Greek member of the general’s staff I mentioned earlier. He’s new to high
command, just joined last November. I met him at the general’s staff conference
in March. He’s surprisingly young, at 29, but friendly and good at management.

"Times New Roman",serif'>King <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span> II, after
learning that he’d be earning a hefty sum of £500,000 from the natives after
the war, decided to initiate the revolt on April 28<sup>th</sup>. His agents
would secretly inform the populace who would rise up in revolt against the
Europeans. In support was an army of 80,000 under General Ahmed <span
class=SpellE>Okoro</span> from the south. The Europeans were caught completely
unawares. The uprising had begun at dawn that morning. By the time <span
class=SpellE>Okoro</span> arrived at 5PM, the whole European population of many
villages had been slaughtered. Cairo was already under siege by African-allied
local militias and rebels. <span class=SpellE>Okoro’s</span> army stormed the
city on May 14<sup>th</sup> and captured it within a day. The only Europeans
left alive were the mayor and his family. Everyone else, excluding native
Africans who agreed to join <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span>, was executed. The
city was looted for the next two days. Due to the surprise and abruptness of
the revolt, the regional governor, <span class=SpellE>Jiwal</span> <span
class=SpellE>Mamureb</span>, a Syrian native, had been unable to call out the
troops at first. Many barracks and military bases in the south were captured
without a shot being fired. Over 20,000 militia and military personnel were
taken prisoner by <span class=SpellE>Okoro’s</span> men in the first two weeks.
On May 10<sup>th</sup>, <span class=SpellE>Mamureb</span> ordered the regional
militias into action, but in several places members of the militia proved loyal
to the Africans and rose up against their fellow soldiers. Civil conflicts broke
out in some cities. After the fall of Cairo, many native Egyptians believed the
Europeans were done for and joined the African side. <span class=SpellE>Mamureb</span>
and the remaining European officials, along with some surviving citizens,
gathered in Alexandria and swiftly forced every non-European out. The Europeans
fortified the city, brought in foodstuffs and prepared themselves for a lengthy
siege. <span class=SpellE>Okoro</span>, rather than marching straight on,
decided to rid the rest of Egypt of any resistance first. He figured that would
take until at least September, at which time he would lay siege to Alexandria
and await reinforcements from the south. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was riding his private boat, the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

patrol squadron appeared on the horizon. The native ship and its four escorts
had struggled to avoid it but Native Americans are not especially skilled in
the art of sailing, whereas the Europeans are experts. The Spanish ships neared
and unleashed volleys of musket fire before firing three broadsides. The
escorts, lacking artillery, rammed the enemy boats head-on and charged over the
sides. The <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Gennise</i></span>
had raised full sail and barely managed to flee the scene with the Spanish

recounted the story to King <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span> II, who heartily
greeted him at the shore. A seriously concerned Blue Potato decided that he

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ferdinand Max</i>, along with 7 frigates. The
army possesses around 35 heavy guns, mainly 6- and 9-pounders. Considering
Alexandria touches the sea, we can even reinforce them by water. Our ships can
pound the city, although that’s only when the Africans take control of it.”<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                             </span>“How

worthless!” cried <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                              </span>“That’s because,
sir,” answered <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>, “we can’t tow any heavier

better ones, too, sir, but they would slow us down considerably.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                  </span>“Hmm…I say we

servant left the conference room for five minutes, and then returned. <span

that he permits the 10,000 troops you want to be taken from the Cyprus
garrison.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                               </span><span
class=SpellE>Gummen</span>, after hearing the message, nearly spit out his

Well, <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>, I think we have our plan all wrapped,
don’t we? It’s a good thing winter is approaching, otherwise we’d have to fight
in the boiling sun, which the Africans are immune to.”<span

large native force is gathering on the beaches. Shall we have our men prepare
themselves for a defense?” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                              </span>“Yes,”
responded Collingwood, who was at the moment surveying the enemy army with a
telescope. “We’ll need every man we’ve got to fend off this horde. It appears
to be three times the size of our own. Bernard! What do you suppose those fools
are doing? They have sent one line of men against us. Why are they not attacking
in the full?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                               
</span>“Sir, I have a feeling they are experimenting to see how we will react
to this minor threat.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                           
</span>“In that case, let’s mislead them. Men, hide the cannons with sheets or

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The first volley went off with a loud bang as 200
muskets fired in unison. 45 of the natives advancing towards the wall at a walk
were killed in an instant. Hiawatha had seen what he had hoped to see. “<span
class=SpellE>Antinanco</span>, lead our three divisions against these pitiful
Europeans with all deliberate speed, please,” requested Hiawatha.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                
</span>“Yes, General.” With that, 40,000 native warriors, all armed with axes,
swords or spears, charged at top velocity towards the defenses. Just ten
seconds later, Collingwood yelled, “Fire!” and 10 cannons went off at once,
tearing massive holes in the native lines. 10 cannons went off at once, tearing
massive holes in the native lines. Two howitzers launched their projectiles as
well, and before Captain <span class=SpellE>Antinanco</span> realized it a
shell was heading straight for his head. The two explosions ended the lives of <span
class=SpellE>Antinanco</span> and 12 other men in a matter of seconds. His death
demoralized the men, and their victorious spirit, boosted by earlier successes,
was lost at the shock of seeing enemy artillery. The first four lines of men
were hit especially hard by musket volleys, sniper fire and cannonballs. It was
massacred, but several troops managed to reach the main gate. At the start of
the attack, five shots from the native warships had knocked down the massive
wooden doors, and instead two lines of heavily armed European infantry were
waiting in the ruins. A volley of musket fire felled the charging warriors. Following
them were more lines of men. However, due to reload time, the muskets could not
kill many. The infantrymen had to deal with a force that grew continuously in
size every few seconds. Luckily, after two minutes of fighting under the
gateway arch European reinforcements arrived. The fighting in the gate swayed
back and forth for the next hour, and casualties mounted on both sides; the
natives far quicker however. The battle had begun at noon. Around 1:30,
Collingwood, seeing that he was going to eventually lose at this rate, ordered
the howitzers brought down from the walls. He had them both placed just behind
the entrance. Then he said for a cease of reinforcements. By 2, the last
European troops under the arch were dead. Unfortunately, a split second later
the natives were greeted by two rounds of grapeshot from the howitzers. 57
native troops were killed immediately, clearing the gateway but leaving the
ground covered with thousands of bodies. Hiawatha decided at three that he did
not like the look of things and called for an end to the battle. He suddenly
realized that all these shots were in vain. Moments later, four broadsides were
unleashed at the wall, which after eight more collapsed. Collingwood, who had
fled back to his headquarters, was engaged in a war council with his
commanders. “General, why didn’t we fire our guns at their ships earlier?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                           
</span>“It’s obvious. They would flee immediately. We would cause a little
damage but that’d be it. I think it caused much more hurt to them doing what we
did. At least 7,000 of their dead line our beach and gateway,” responded
Collingwood.<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                     </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                    </span>“Sir,
do we retreat or stay and fight? I would consider retreating and saving an
army.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                        
</span>“What are our chances of winning?” asked Collingwood. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                    </span>“We
have around 17,000 men left. They have an estimated 50,000. It is unlikely that
we will win against those odds.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          
</span>“In that case, I agree. Let’s make a hasty a hasty retreat back to Fort
Ottawa. At least we’ve got a good excuse this time. There’s no way <span

his horse as 2,000 elite European grenadiers stayed back to cover the
evacuation of 15,000 soldiers and the entire Sault St. Marie population. “General
Hiawatha, we’ve won,” said a fellow commander. “The Europeans are retreating

beneficial factor is that we have gained some foodstuffs, muskets and
ammunition for our army. The Africans cannot supply us with firearms due to the
fact that they do not have enough themselves. Asia is much closer to the
Europeans than they are to Africa or us and is not willing to trade guns for
our goods. South America is even less civilized than we are. Do not let the men
know, but I doubt we shall ever repeat a victory of this scale in this war. Until
we can obtain the technology of our enemy, they will always retain a
significant advantage over us. We have strength in numbers at the moment, but
how long this can last is in question. Tell Blue Potato that we must, we must
capture Quebec while the Africans can still support us or we stand no chance of

transport fleets to Alexandria harbor, carrying a total of 85,000 troops. The

city. The rest landed four miles away, just on the outskirts of the city walls.
Some sentries stationed nearby informed <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> that
the city had been under siege for two weeks now, and this area of the wall had
been filled with African troops until they saw the European ships coming. “<span

not fall since we just reinforced the garrison with food, weapon and
ammunition, and 10,000 troops. I need you to lead a force of 2,000 light

class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span> was not pleased. “The Africans haven’t sent as
many men as we thought. I do hope Frey can combat such a large enemy army.
Unlike the natives of North America, the troops of this nation actually possess
firearms. At least we’ve got artillery, which I’m not sure they don’t.”
However, he was wrong. Moments later, 10-pound cannonballs came flying towards
his units. “Oh lord!” <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span> cried as 5 of his men
were unhorsed by a single shot. Other cannonballs whizzed by, killing more
troops and horses. “Move! Move! Attack that infantry column over there!” yelled
<span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span> as he pointed towards a seemingly unaware
African infantry unit. Unfortunately, it formed square just as <span
class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>’ cavalry neared and fired a volley point-blank. Miraculously,
the commander himself, riding at the head of his division, was not touched but
three bodyguards were killed and 39 others killed or unhorsed. <span
class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span> remained undeterred. “Continue the attack!” he
screamed over the sound of cannon fire. The European light cavalry charged
straight into the fray, while 800 of them were ordered by <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>
to fend off any African infantry nearby who might use their guns to effect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>African second-in-command Juke <span class=SpellE>Bomani</span>,
having been told that his boss was not in a good mood, decided to finish off
the Europeans as quick as possible. He had watched the European cavalry move
wildly upon being hit by cannonballs and then race towards an infantry column
that was facing the other way. It had formed square, and seeing that the
Europeans were completely focused on it, <span class=SpellE>Bomani</span>
realized that he had a perfect situation developing. “All right, men! Let’s
ambush <span class=GramE>those unwary enemy cavalry</span> down there!” His
force charged down the slope straight at the Europeans, who were caught trapped
with Africans on all sides. <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>, fighting like
a madman, managed to escape the slaughter with three bodyguards but practically
all his men were killed. 45 minutes later, him and his exhausted horse finally
reached the safety of the European camp. <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> was
waiting for them. Luckily, he had been having more success. The European
infantry had engaged the Africans in a musket shootout, which lasted for two
hours. Both sides were determined not to give in, and as a result thousands of
men were lost. In the end, however, <span class=SpellE>Gummen’s</span> more
disciplined, better-equipped and trained troops won the day, and 14,000 African
soldiers routed from the field. <span class=SpellE>Okoro</span>, now finally
alert, ordered his men to launch a counterattack with heavy cavalry supported
by artillery. But <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span> ordered his infantry to form
square, and the first wave of cavalry was repelled. However, the African
artillery opened up on the unmovable and vulnerable squares, and six were obliterated.
The fighting along the walls continued until 7 PM, with <span class=SpellE>Okoro</span>
launching cavalry against the squares, then having them turn back just before
they were within range of the European muskets, and letting his artillery pound
the infantry squares. The Alexandria defenders used their own cannon to effect,
firing from the top of the walls and causing immense damage among the African
columns. It proved to be a most bitter and bloody afternoon, which caused both
sides horrific losses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>As Collingwood spoke, things were looking down in
Europe. Alexander Weber, one of the three top generals on High Command, had
just lost a reelection campaign for Austrian Governor. Although the exact
reasons were not clear, his advisors suggested that it might have been due to a
growing general dislike of the war. Taxes had grown higher and higher, despite
the promises of Emperor Phillips, and the continuous reports of defeat after
defeat from Canada did not improve the situation. Crowds of protestors
regularly gathered outside European high command HQ in Paris and under the
Brandenburg Gate in Berlin every Sunday, demanding an end to the conflict. Violence
had not yet erupted, but the chances grew ever more likely each day. Fortunately,
at this point the crowds were small, averaging just 30-40 people. However, <span
class=SpellE>Gerppin</span> <span class=SpellE>Sokolov</span>, the justice
minister, had already notified the emperor that if the protestors expanded to
500 or more, he would call out the local police to quell a potential uprising. With
the war only having lasted about a year, public opinion of the war and the
government’s management of it still remained at a steady 70% approval rating. The
European treasury still had a large stockpile of nearly 600,000 guilders (1
guilder=$1.2 USD). It was certainly a hefty amount, but Emperor Phillips still
worried. His campaign for emperor had consisted of many speeches promoting his
economic plan. He had said many times in the past year that he would do his
best to keep taxes where they were. They had increased by about .5% overall so
far during his tenure as monarch. There was no need to inflate that number at
the moment, but he knew that if the military situation in Canada and Africa did
not improve, he’d be forced to do so. A senior commander who had so far failed
in Canada had been already been relocated to Africa, along with a new, young
officer as second-in-command. But what about in Canada? Both fronts were in bad
shape. The only things to be done for Africa was await results, but Phillips
had an option in North America. After several days of discussion with his
advisors, including Weber, the emperor declared that he agreed with
Governor-general <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>. If General Collingwood did
not bring a victory in his next confrontation with the natives, he would be
replaced. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>General Collingwood set out from Fort Ottawa for
Montréal on September 22<sup>nd</sup>. He had spent the past week dispersing
anti-war activists within the fortress and trying to gather new recruits. He
headed off to do the same thing in Canada’s major cities, hoping for a new boost
of eager, energetic and devoted soldiers in the spring for the upcoming Mexican
campaign. Knowing that he would be fired should this fresh scheme fail; he
needed to have the best possible troops available to carry it out. If it did
not, though, Collingwood was aware that angry family members and lovers, for
wiping out the young male Canadian generations, would blame him. It was not a
pretty picture. Collingwood had already sent four groups, in total 50 men, to
scout the landing area down south and report back in March as to the condition
of the region. He wanted to know how many troops the natives had in reserves
there and the scale of the coastal defenses. If the beach in the Gulf was
heavily guarded than the navy could shell the shore, if not, to save time the
troops would just land and storm in. Discussing this with Ivanov, the newly
arrived Russian commander, Collingwood learned that he would have a hard time
gathering additional recruits. The war was especially unpopular in Canada and
in fact a significant portion of men between the ages of 20-55 had already fled
to the barely inhabited outskirts of the colony to avoid being drafted. Upon
hearing this, the general called an end to his trip on the spot. Spending just
one night in Montréal, the mayor told him the same thing during their dinner
together. The following morning, Collingwood returned to Fort Ottawa and
concluded that instead of encouraging the troops to come out in person he would
have to force them out using conscription for the first time in the war. Ivanov
and <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> both warned that this would make things
even worse, but the Canadian army head did not listen. “I have made up my mind.
That is what I will do.” <span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                      </span>“Are
you sure, sir? I think the tour was a much better idea. It may be
time-consuming, but you wanted to do a little sightseeing. Plus, it’s not like
we had much to do around here anyways in the coming months…” stammered Ivanov.
“No, Maxim. If you really hate what I’m doing, how about I sweeten it up?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I’ll personally handle the paperwork with you
and the <span class=GramE>accountants</span> downstairs. I know there’s a ton
of conscription forms to fill out and complete. The war department is not just
about planning strategies and presenting ideas at conferences.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                            
</span>“Gee, General, you’d actually do that for us? Just because there’s not
much else to do?”<span

"Times New Roman",serif'>As winter approached in Europe in Canada, the
temperature remained at a steady 95° F in the North African desert. The
Africans under <span class=SpellE>Okoro</span> took advantage of the heat to
taunt the European troops, most of which were used to the chilly, rainy or mild
climates of Great Britain, France and Italy. The Greek and Turkish troops did
not suffer quite as much but it was still unpleasant for them. The African
forces, immune to the extreme heat waves and unbearable sun, light plants on fire
at night so that the smoke would drift downhill into the enemy camps. What
could be carried away from the wells and oases was filled in with sand and
dirt, or dumped onto the ground, where it evaporated within seconds. General <span

serious, Frey. We should leave. If we continue the campaign, we’ll lose more
men to the desert than we will to the enemy. On the other hand, their territory
surrounds us on 3 sides and their troops are immune to the heat. They’re much
better suited to fighting here. I mean, what is Egypt really worth to us? We
don’t need it to survive. After all, it’s forcing us to fight a two-front war.
I’d say Canada is far more valuable. It’s much larger, and we can expand south
in North America. The natives may have won the previous battles but they lack
the technology the Africans possess. I say we should quit the land war here and
send all these troops back to Canada. Doesn’t that seem like a better idea? I
think we should even just start a blockade of the West African coast to prevent
any sort of trade or communication between these two ‘allies’, the Dakota
Confederacy and Africa. We already control the Mediterranean, so they can’t
possibly send anything through there.”<span

for <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>, his opponent <span class=SpellE>Okoro’s</span>
handy, reliable spy network had managed to infiltrate the European camp. One of
the agents, dressed as a European soldier, had been sitting on a stool inside a
tent nearby as the two commanders spoke that night. Pretending to compile the
day in his diary, he was in reality jotting down their conversation word for
word. When a sentry opened the tent flap around 10 to suggest that the
“private” put down his pen and slumber, the agent walked out, supposedly to use
the restroom, then, as soon as the sentry’s back was turned, he dashed behind a
cactus. After another hour of waiting, the opportunity he had been waiting for
arrived: the guards in the vicinity had all fallen asleep. Without making a
sound, the spy crawled past the snoring sentries and made a run for it under
the cover of darkness. Four days later, in the safety of his office in Cairo,
general <span class=SpellE>Okoro</span> began to read the transcript. The
African king <span class=SpellE>Ubinu</span> II had arrived in the city on the
5<sup>th</sup> and happened to be spending the day with <span class=SpellE>Okoro</span>.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Emperor Phillips had received some unexpected news
over the course of the month of November. First, the commander-in-chief of the
Canadian front, Charles Collingwood, had stated that he was going to use the
draft to forcefully recruit new troops for a spring campaign in Mexico, to
divert native forces away from the north. It seemed like a highly radical idea,
and one that the emperor did not fully support. Upon hearing the news on
November 17<sup>th</sup>, the emperor immediately sent a reply, stating that
Collingwood was forbidden from putting the plan into action until he received
written approval from Phillips himself. Before allowing this to take place,
Phillips wanted to consult his advisors and seek their opinion on what he
believed to be was a very foolish strategy, and one that would most likely hurt
the European establishment in Canada more than the natives. On the 25<sup>th</sup>,
Major General and Austrian governor (to be replaced in less than 5 months)
Alexander Weber, John Sterling, the ambassador to the Dakota Confederacy and
Vice Admiral Herbert Vincent met in their traditional conference room in the
Paris military headquarters. “Gentlemen, I have called you all here today to
discuss how we should treat this newly developed plan prepared for us by our
associate Charles Collingwood, the head of the Canadian military,” began
Emperor Phillips, who stood at the front of the room in front of a large North
American map and wielding a pointer. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                    </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                     </span>“I
agree with you, Emperor,” started Weber. “This does not look very wise to me.
It will be costly and time-consuming to levy so many men who do not even want
to enlist in the first place. Then they have to be shipped down south to the
Gulf of Mexico to die or be maimed. I’ll bet those natives have already
infiltrated our command structure and know every exact detail of this plan,
word for word, or are aiming to retrieve it as we speak. I think, rather than
allow another failure, we should stop this immediately and fire Collingwood
before a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>potential</i> defeat turns into
a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>true</i> defeat.” <span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                      </span>“Quite
frankly, I am not a strategist, but a diplomat. I would not have attended this
meeting if I was not cordially invited by you, your highness,” said Sterling,
which triggered a frown on Phillips’ face. “But seeing as though I’m here, I
may as well deliver my opinion. I reckon maybe we should try what we did four
wars back, when we were fighting the Irish and Welsh rebels. Diplomatically, I
would be happy to negotiate a peace with the natives, and then two months
later, right when they let their guard down, we burn the treaty to ashes and
launch a surprise attack. The situation is not very different from that in the
last war I referenced. The natives’ numbers are low compared to us, as were the
Irish and Welsh. They lack firearms and proper gunnery. They possess a navy of
practically no value or use whatsoever. I think against these odds we should be
able to easily win. As such, I propose that we negotiate a false peace, wait
for them to grow unaware, then strike while the iron is hot and achieve total
victory in a matter of weeks.” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                </span>“Thank you for your input,”
replied the emperor. “Now, Vice Admiral Vincent, you may speak.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                      
</span>“Merci,” responded the admiral, standing up from his chair. “I, being a
master of sea warfare, not land warfare, have little to say. I am not going to
judge this scheme of Collingwood’s nicely or harshly, since it is primarily one
continentally related. I can only state that his plans for landing and
transport along the coastline seem well founded and perfectly doable. I am
willing and ready to execute the order for such a maneuver should I ever
receive it. That is all I have to comment. Thank you very much, your highness,”
and with that, he sat back down. <span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                 </span>“Seeing as though we have only
two options delivered, I am afraid I have a difficult decision to make. Please
excuse me for a second.” With that, the emperor left the room. Weber, Vincent
and Sterling all continued to sit in their seats and waited in silence for
fifteen minutes. Finally, the emperor returned with a half-full glass of wine
in his hand. “I have concluded my decision. We shall follow <i

effectively lost the region and the enemy controls it too strongly for us to
every be able to take it back. We could try, but I think that it would just
lead to more bloodshed. I don’t think that’s such a good idea. The odds of
victory are about 60-1. I feel as though we should just give up Africa to the
Africans, at least for the time being. Instead, we should work on a blockade.
Right now, we are falling straight into their hands. They want us to remain and
stay focused on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>two</i> fronts instead of
one. I’d much rather maintain a blockade and put these troops to good use
somewhere else. They’ll only die in huge numbers in the desert. Thank you, my

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'> <span
class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span> had offered to clean up the situation in Egypt,
making him one of the last Europeans to leave. His boss, Frey <span
class=SpellE>Gummen</span>, had eagerly accepted. Now, at the start of
December, he was on his way back to Paris, while <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>
was busy evacuating European citizens from Alexandria, along with all military
supplies and utilities. “Leave nothing!” he ordered on the 2<sup>nd</sup> to
the few remaining troops who had not already left for Europe. “Destroy
everything which could be of use to the enemy! Burn down the city if you must!
We are not going to return! The Africans must not find anything of value in
this abandoned city!” After being informed by an officer that the walls
themselves could potentially help the Africans in rebuilding Alexandria, <span
class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span> had decided that they, too, must be dismantled.
On December 5<sup>th</sup>, an army of 20,000 laborers, mostly prisoners of
war, began deconstruction of the city walls. <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>’
second-in-command, Liam Weis, was put in charge of the project. “Liam! How long
is this going to take? Winter here isn’t any colder than summer, but I want to
get out of here as soon as possible. High command isn’t allotting us any extra
protection, and we’ve only got the city garrison of 10,000 left.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>               </span>“The engineers say that it’s
going to take at least four months to take down the whole wall. Plus, we’ll
still need another 2 weeks to load all this onto the ships. I’m afraid we’ll be
stuck here for a while, sir.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                   
</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                    </span>“Aw,
shucks, Liam. I don’t believe this. I should never have offered to handle this
for <span class=SpellE>Gummen</span>. He’s probably living it high and swell in
his cabin while we’re sweating in the hot sun, supervising workers.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                           
</span>“I’m not satisfied either, sir. This place is dangerous without the
army’s protection. The Africans could easily just swoop in with their cavalry
and artillery and blow this whole operation sky high and slaughter what little
troops we do have. In fact, I’m puzzled as to why they haven’t already.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>That night, around 9:30PM, 10 masked African agents approached
a part of the wall where a former side gate had once stood. There was hardly
anything left of it but rubble and a pile of stone blocks. Two agents crawled
up behind the pile and peeked over. Three sentries were standing just a few
feet away from them. After another half-hour of waiting, two of the guards had
left for a different sector. The seven other agents, looking on from a safe
distance behind, saw that there were no other guards in the vicinity and one of
them promptly chucked his dagger at the sole remaining sentry. It struck him in
the throat, but just before he hit the ground one of the agents behind the pile
reached forward and grabbed him. The bleeding dead body was dragged 30 feet
away and left behind a tree. The three agents then quickly ran into the camp
and crouched behind a tent. One of them looked over the corner and, seeing that
the coast was clear, they continued to run past tents and fires. At one point,
a lieutenant eating dinner over a fire outdoors spotted the group, but he was
immediately strangled before he even let out a cry. It took almost twenty
minutes of navigation, but the trio did eventually locate <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>’
tent. As predicted, there were two guards at the entrance. The three men hid
behind the ruins of a shack, several feet away, and discussed in whispers what
to do. “What can we do?” one of them asked. “We haven’t any grenades, and we
can’t shoot them down. We lack European attire or costumes…we can’t just run up
and stab them...”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                      
</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        </span>“However, we can cause a
distraction.” And with that, the second man grabbed a piece of wood nearby and
brought it to a streetlight. He then hurled it to the left of <span
class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>’ tent. It caught one of the guards’ eyes and he
walked in the direction of the burning wood to investigate. At that exact
moment, the three men charged up to the other guard and in a solid swift move,
the first man took off his head in one blow using his sword. They then entered
the tent, and the second man took out his pistol, and then pointed it straight
at <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>, who was sitting at his desk with his
back to the Africans. He turned around just in time to see the gun jam. “Hey!
What are you doing in here? Who are you?” yelled an angry <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>.
He grabbed the pistol and threw it to the ground, then took out his dagger. “<span
class=GramE>You’re</span> African spies, aren’t you? Trying to assassinate me,
eh? Guards! Guards!” bellowed the commander. “Come quick!” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                  </span>The agents, stunned by the
sudden turn of events, took several seconds to react. The third man tried to
pull his own pistol out, but was punched in the face by <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>,
who then pushed him hard into the first agent, who fell onto the bed, dropping
his sword. The second man threw a blow at <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>’
stomach, which hit, but then the commander kicked him in the knee. He tripped,
fell onto the desk, and was stabbed in the back by <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>’
dagger. At the moment, the guard arrived, with 4 other troops following closely
behind him. “Ah-ha!” said the guard, who raised his musket and prepared to aim.
But just before he pulled the trigger, the third man, who had pulled himself
back up, dived for <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>’ legs. The commander
began to trip towards the bed, and due to a very coincidental phenomenon, the
musket ball penetrated his eye and exited through the other side of his head. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>“This is completely, positively, totally dreadful,”
said justice minister <span class=SpellE>Gerppin</span> <span class=SpellE>Sokolov</span>.
It was 3PM on February 16<sup>th</sup> in the main conference room of <span
class=GramE>his the</span> justice department headquarters in Vienna, Austria. “I
never foresaw that our dear general <span class=SpellE>Dimitrios</span> <span
class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span> would be assassinated, or the even more bizarre
twist of fate that led to him being killed by one his own men. At least we have
a relatively easy verdict ahead of us.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                         </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                              </span>“Maybe
so, but like you, <span class=SpellE>Sokolov</span>, I am just completely
stunned at this event,” replied Emperor Phillips. “I had not anticipated such
atrocities so early in my reign. But please, Mr. de Groot, state the facts of
the case.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                 
</span>Mr. Vince de Groot, the lawyer of the bodyguard who shot <span
class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>, stood up. “Lord Phillips, this is a very simple
and basic trial. My client, <span class=SpellE>Christios</span> <span
class=SpellE>Kazlauskas</span>, was trying to shoot one of the Africans in the
tent, who was, as we recall, wielding a very large sword. But this agent, a
clever one, threw himself at the commander who began to fall, putting himself
straight in the line of fire. The musket ball therefore hit <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>him</i> in the head instead of the African.
It was a pure mistake on the soldier’s part. But we cannot blame it completely
on him, for he did exactly what any other loyal European would have done. He
used what he had at hand to try and take down this dangerous enemy.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                     
</span>“But why didn’t he use his bayonet instead? I’d think it would work just
as well,” questioned the opposing lawyer, representing the three African agents
involved in the affair. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                       </span>“Because
the guy holding onto <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span> would’ve used his
gigantic sword to keep the guards at bay. He’d put the general’s throat at
sword point and if anyone approached him he’d shove it up <span class=SpellE>Nicoladis</span>’
head. It’s a win-lose situation. There was no other option at that point. I
think it’s very clear who wins in this trial.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                              </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                           </span>“I
wouldn’t exactly say that just yet,” Mr. de Groot,” responded the justice
minister. “That takes place a year from now, in February 1803. In the meantime,
the justice department will be rounding up randomly selected members of the
population to prepare a jury. They will be taken from all over the continent to
get an even distribution. Everyone who was present at the event, including the
two living African agents and the killer, will be brought in.”<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Meanwhile, 2.5 months earlier, there had been a lively
New Year’s celebration in Africa, Europe and North America. The one in Africa
had also largely been in rejoice over the recent victory, but that all changed
after Paris sent in two massive armies to protect Alexandria following the
“bloody incident”. Europe and the natives both had little to honor, but it
proved to a decent morale boost, especially for the Europeans, sorrow over
numerous military defeats. Collingwood, on the other hand, was devastated by
his termination, which had taken place starting in the New Year. He had spent
January 1 sulking in his bedroom, watching from the window as attendants
carried property into the house from his former office. He had become depressed
ever since learning that he was fired from Governor-general <span class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span>
two weeks earlier. At age 40, Collingwood still had some time to go before
retirement. He decided to spend the next 3 years traveling around Europe,
writing a book about his life and what he believed he could have done
differently. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>At the same time, on January 22<sup>nd</sup>, 1802,
Native Chief Blue Potato returned to North America. A large crowd of onlookers
greeted him as his flagship approached the shore. Blue Potato, eager to speak
with his commanders in the Fort Toronto field headquarters, rather than soaking
in the admiration of the crowd, walked through at a fast pace, ignoring
requests for autographs and an interview. In a matter of seconds, he had
reached his waiting carriage, which raced off immediately. His ship having
docked in <span class=SpellE>Bostinne</span> Harbor, it would take him about 3
weeks to travel from there to the fort. From <span class=SpellE>Bostinne</span>,
he rode the carriage for 5 days non-stop to the capital of <span class=SpellE>Yorppu</span>
province, Alban. At Alban, Blue Potato transferred to a larger stagecoach,
holding three standard-size rooms and escorted by mounted policemen at all
times. Another change at Alban was the addition of General Bone Wrangler, whose
task was to update the chief on the current military situation. However, Blue
Potato, exhausted from nights of poor sleep on a bumpy, rickety carriage,
demanded and was granted 9 hours’ rest in his cabin before the briefing. The
following morning, Bone Wrangler began halfway through breakfast. “Now, Chief,
while you were away, in mid-summer Blood Drawer decided to launch an attack on Sault
St. Marie, which is one of the westernmost Canadian settlements. <span
class=GramE>So</span> he sent General Hiawatha on a mission to capture the
town, which our spies believed held a force and population much lower than the
force we intended to send against it. The attack was a success, and although we
sustained losses, Mr. Hiawatha was able to take the city. The general idea
behind Blood Drawer’s strategy was to capture Sault St. Marie, and then move
east from there against Sudbury, Ottawa, Montréal, and eventually Québec. I
think we can ascertain that after Québec is seized, there is little that will
stand in the way of us forcing the Europeans out of Canada. What do you have to
comment on anything of relevance, Chief?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>“Seems like a decent plan to
me,” replied Blue Potato as he took a bite of acorn bread. “Kind of like a
‘city-hopping’ theme. The only problem is…I’m not sure how we will force the
Europeans to surrender their cities to us. A siege won’t do it, Bone Wrangler.
Fort Ottawa is well protected. It probably holds at least 30,000 men, with
plenty of artillery, ammunition and food stocks. It can be easily resupplied by
the other large settlements to the north.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                  
</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                 </span>“Don’t worry,
Chief. We have a way around this issue. Blood Drawer says that he’ll use our
heavy artillery to pound their ways to smithereens, then make our way in using
brute force. Have no fear, Chief; there shall not be any imperfections. He has
even planned out a landing of 20,000 mounted troops using the navy. This force
will sail up Lake Ontario, land just south of Fort Ottawa and in the dead of
night, and surprise the enemy defenders by scaling their walls from the rear!
It’s a foolproof plan that’s bound to succeed!”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                   
</span>“Oh, I wouldn’t get so excited about this scheme just yet. We have had
too many sequential victories and practically no losses. The chances of that
pattern reversing itself increase after each triumph.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Elias Gustafson stood watching from a sofa in the
lobby as servants carried his personal items and furniture from a wagon to his
new office on the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor of the European field headquarters in
Quebec. It was January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1802. Governor-general Girard de <span
class=SpellE>Bouqonet</span> had just sworn him in as the new head of Canadian
armed forces two days ago. It was now 4PM. Gustafson had met with his advisors
that morning. He had officially announced to them that he was removing
Collingwood’s invasion of Mexico from the agenda. Instead, he would focus on
the navy, in order to achieve dominance on the Great Lakes. That way, for the
natives to reinforce their base, Fort Toronto, they would have to go by land,
either to the west, beyond Lake Superior, cross the pass which would be guarded
by European forces, or move overland at Montréal, also a heavily defended
European border. From there, the plan was to cut off Fort Toronto, and
hopefully the high-positioned native leaders as well, most importantly Blue
Potato. The Canadian <span class=SpellE>genera’s</span> staff had happily
approved the plan. The navy was scheduled to initiate the blockade operation,
codenamed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Venus</i>, on March 20<sup>th</sup>,
1802, using a total of 80 warships. Gustafson had sent the details of the plan
off to high command in Paris for approval. In the meantime, he would do what
Collingwood had decided not to and go on a regional tour to try and rally up
support. The goal was the same as Collingwood had stated: Encourage as many
males, between the ages of 20-55, preferably on the younger end, to enlist for
the coming year. In fact, to promote the tour, one of Gustafson’s first acts in
office was to abolish the mandatory draft, which Collingwood had begun
enforcing the previous fall. The tour was scheduled to last from January 10<sup>th</sup>
to February 25<sup>th</sup>, and cover all the major cities in southern Canada,
as well as touch some of the outskirts to draw in as many fresh recruits as
possible. Québec, Montréal, Fort Ottawa, Sudbury, Fort Albany and its surroundings,
and even cities as distant as <span class=SpellE>Shefferville</span>, Goose Bay
and St. Anthony on the Atlantic Coast would be reached. After rallying in
Northern Canada, Gustafson hoped to make the most of his trip by taking the
slow route back to Québec, and taking time to make an appearance in as many
towns as he could along the St. Lawrence. The last settlement he wished to
visit was a small, obscure village known as Pine Dock, just 25 miles northeast
of Québec. The journey could take months, and as a result Gustafson did not
feel confident that he could wrap things up by the end of February, in time to
lead the attack against Fort Toronto in the spring. In such a scenario, which
was highly likely, he had already picked out the interim commander-in-chief of
the operation, Maxim Ivanov, the newly arrived Russian general, who would hold
the position until Gustafson returned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>At this point, both sides had devised plans of action
for the upcoming spring season: European and native. It was a matter of who
took the initiative and attacked first. Unfortunately, Blue Potato learned on
January 28<sup>th</sup> that the invasion planned by Blood Drawer was scheduled
to begin in mid-April. Although the chief did not know it at the time, that
one-month difference would cost his nation dearly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Just as planned, at 5AM on March 20<sup>th</sup>, the
80 warships took off from Québec under the command of Vice Admiral Herbert
Vincent. Gustafson’s plan had been approved by high command, which had
surprisingly voyaged over from Europe and arrived at the beginning of March,
due to Emperor Phillips’ desire to command the war personally. He had brought
with him an elite group of men who he hoped would allow this offensive to be
the one that would finally tip the scales back in European favor. This highly
trained, top-ranking group included: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

and 700 more transports, along with 150 artillery pieces. That makes a combined

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The native generals were taken completely by surprise.
Just as Gustafson had hoped, Blue Potato, Blood Drawer and <span class=SpellE>Pollum</span>
Hiawatha were caught trapped in the Fort Toronto landmass, although he did not
know this. The European navy under Vincent moved in with speed and by April 4<sup>th</sup>
the blockade was in place. Lakes Huron, Erie and Ontario were now all swarming
with European warships. The transports carried troops to various locations
where they blocked up any potential escape routes. The land bridges connecting
the landmass to the Dakota town of <span class=SpellE>Detrito</span> and Fort
Ottawa were now guarded by thousands of European troops, who began construction
of watchtowers and defensive walls. Next, the navy shelled the coastal town of
Hamilton, bombarding it until it was leveled and burning. Upon finishing this,
Vice Admiral Herbert Vincent ordered 4,000 of his sailors forward into the
ruins to take any survivors, if either nobles or in reasonable shape, prisoner.
Everyone else was to be executed. While watching the town slowly go up in
flames, Emperor Phillips arrived in his flagship, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Royal Oak</i>. “Hello there, Admiral!” he called from the deck of his
ship. “Good to see you, your highness. How are you doing? Would you care to
join me in watching the destruction of our enemy’s village? I just had our
ships pound it to the point of disintegration.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                   
</span>“Good to hear, good to hear, Herbert. You wouldn’t happen to have any
fine Chenin Blanc, would you, Admiral?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>        
</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                </span>“As a matter of fact, I have a

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>As the European commanders were rejoicing at the
magnitude of their surprise attack, the troops on the ground were approaching
their destinations. The navy had already landed 15,000 veterans on the overland
route connecting Fort Toronto to <span class=SpellE>Detrito</span>, and by the
morning of April 4<sup>th</sup> walls were being erected to keep anyone from
going in or out. Gustafson planned to send another 5,000 new recruits in as
reinforcement within the next two weeks. The same was occurring on the thin
pass just north of Lake Ontario, but that was already European territory. The
wall therefore was only one-sided, but still 12,000 troops patrolled it. The
entire operation was proceeding just as planned. Gustafson, sitting in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Northumberland</i>, now his official
personal ship, viewed the horrific fire consuming Hamilton just a few thousand
feet from where the emperor and Vincent were witnessing the same scene. He had
directed the troops blocking the two overland escape routes from Fort Toronto,
of which both groups were now in place. On the 8<sup>th</sup> he would be in
Fort Ottawa, and from there personally lead an army of 50,000, in addition to
the elite faction headed by Emperor Phillips, against Toronto. The final goal
was capture of the top native commanders, but even now European high command
was still uncertain as to whether Blue Potato, the enemy chief, was in the
fortress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>The native head himself was in a rare state of being.
He had been laying on his bed for the past five days and nights without eating,
and only taking occasional sips of water and tea. Blue Potato was
panic-stricken and beyond distressed by the current situation. He was trapped
in Fort Toronto, with only 20,000 men and two generals. There was no way to
communicate with the outside world due to the enemy blockade. His own navy was
rubbish in comparison to the Europeans’. The circumstances appeared excessively
bleak. How could this be resolved? Blue Potato had already spoken with Hiawatha
and Blood Drawer in 2 emergency councils of war, but the two commanders had no
solutions of their own. As a result, the defenders’ morale sank significantly. Blue
Potato began to request paper, ink and a quill pen in addition to his daily
water and tea, so that he could start drafting his papers of surrender to
Emperor Phillips. <span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>Around 9AM on April 8<sup>th</sup>, 1802, Gustafson’s
“Trounce of Triumph” began. For half an hour, he spoke to his army, hoping that
it would motivate the men and give them maximum morale. The only order of the
day before had been to get a good night’s sleep, so everyone would be in prime
physical condition. Foolishly, Gustafson forgot to send out scouts, and his
fellow commanders, not wanting to spoil the moment by voicing an error, did not
point out the mistake to him. As a result, the columns were startled a day later
when their lines were raked by sniper fire coming from within the woodland on
both sides. Gustafson had 3,000 of his troops scare them away, first by firing
several volleys into the forest and then chasing the snipers until they fled. After
the incident, which had caused 800 casualties and undid all that Gustafson’s
speech had done, the march continued peacefully. However, this was what only
what the general was told. Unaware to the rest of the force, 2,000 native light
horsemen had cut off Dean Michel’s elite artillery batteries, which had fallen
behind due to their slow pace, from the main body. The cavalry easily
slaughtered the helpless artillerymen, armed with only daggers and sabers, and
cut the unit to pieces. Michel himself managed to flee back to Fort Ottawa, but
he was one of only 3 survivors. No one was able to inform Gustafson about what
had happened. The horsemen, meanwhile, suffering just 4 men wounded and one
horse killed, captured 40 guns of the best French artillery, as well as many
rounds of ammunition. Unfortunately, they did come with operators, but the
cavalry had been told to exterminate them, as it was not believed that they
would be willing to fire on their comrades. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>On April 15<sup>th</sup>, Gustafson’ army of Southern
Canada, still numbering nearly 100,000 men, reached Fort Toronto. Emperor
Phillips himself had left the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Royal Oak</i>
the previous day to witness this dramatic battle in person. His wife, the
empress Sophia Meyer, was also present. It was not until 3PM, though, with the
European troops already in action fighting the defenders that Maxim Ivanov, one
of Gustafson’s top-ranking subordinates, realized that Dean Michel’s heavy
artillery was missing. He immediately reported his finding to Gustafson. The
general, suddenly alarmed, sent a messenger to Québec, requesting some heavy
guns. Lacking artillery, the only way Gustafson could win the siege was by mass
assault. The following morning, the sleepy native sentries watching the plains
ahead of them were startled by a cascade of bullets. Seconds later, they were
all dead. Franz Müller’s deadly <span class=SpellE>jägers</span> had struck
again. The <span class=GramE>guards</span> dead, 9,000 European infantry began
to scale the wall using ladders, but were met by vicious Dakota warriors armed
with heavy axes and swords. The close combat atop the wall continued fiercely
into the afternoon. After a pause in the fighting for dinner around 7PM,
Gustafson took a gamble and sent the Scottish royal guards, led by their
captain, William Davis, along with <span class=GramE>20,000 line</span>
infantry. The European troops slowly marched up to the base of the wall, the
normal infantry’s morale boosted by the presence of the Scottish elites. However,
the feeling did not last. Just as the royal guards reached the top of the wall,
they were lit aflame. The natives had prepared mini-lanterns, full of highly
flammable oils. The elite soldiers panicked and many fell right off the wall to
their deaths. It was a horrific sight. The line infantry behind them,
frightened, routed and fled back to the safety of their camp. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>There were no more assaults for the next 4 days. On
April 22<sup>nd</sup>, Gustafson called a council of war aboard the largest
ship in the fleet, the 125-gun <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Prince of
Orange</i>. Alexander Weber and Maxim Ivanov, the two major generals present,
delivered their beliefs to Gustafson. “The situation grows worse by day,” said
Weber. “We’ve lost all our artillery to the natives. I myself took a battalion
of light cavalry to investigate, and we discovered the corpses of all of Dean
Michel’s artillerymen. However, every last gun was gone, and so was the
ammunition. Since horse imprints were rampant over the field, I have reason to
believe that the natives cut off the artillery column and massacred it, then
made off with some of our finest cannonry! Chances are, they’ll begin using our
own guns against us, once they can figure out how to fire them. Assault after
assault on those walls has proven unsuccessful. What can we do? I recommend we prepare
a battering ram and try to take down that main gate. The Scottish royal guards
have suffered heavy losses, and so we’re sending them home. The Russian
Imperials and the Berlin police officers remain fit for battle, but I would not
commit them just yet. Morale is growing lower and lower. I say while we wait
for the replacement artillery to arrive, we try out this battering ram. Maxim,
your thoughts?” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                    </span>“Well,
I would suggest that we send in some spies to figure out exactly what the enemy
is thinking. No doubt they want to confront and defeat us before our substitute
cannons can be put to use. But in what way, where and when? I’d like to figure
that question out. Mr. Weber, your idea is a good one. But I believe there is a
better option. Mr. Gustafson, is it possible that we could call in our ships to
bombard the fort?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                      
</span>“I’m afraid not, Maxim. Their range is not sufficient to fire upon the
enemy base. But where exactly are you going with your spy plan, Mr. Ivanov?”<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                     </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                    </span>“I think we
should attempt to kidnap Blue Potato,” said Ivanov, causing multiple gasps in
response. “We have the loyal and expertly-trained agents available to conduct
such a maneuver, no?”<span

"Times New Roman",serif'>At the same time, deep inside Fort Toronto, Blue
Potato conferred with his advisors in an underground bunker. “Gentlemen,” he
began, “we are in a very constrained and challenging situation. We have only
two generals here, not including myself, and we are cut off from the outside
world. We have just a handful of troops to defend us. The enemy has thoroughly
surrounded this fortress. Their warships control the Great Lakes, their troops
march across the region. Our own forces will take months to travel here by
land. Our cavalry was luckily able to capture the European artillery, and that
is why our walls have not been bombarded to ashes. But they are bringing in
replacement guns, and those will arrive soon. We must somehow drive away the
enemy forces, and their ships, before the artillery shows up, or we are all
going to die. Does anyone have a solution?” asked Blue Potato with a grim
expression on his face. <span

Chief, but I believe the best way to handle this is by waging a battle. Let’s

path to take. That is all,” finished Hiawatha.<span

am afraid not, Chief. I completely agree with <span class=SpellE>Pollum</span>.

long as we can while waiting for rescue, or take the fight to them.”<span

</span>“I see. As Chief of the Dakota Confederacy, I hereby declare that we are
going to do battle against the European empire!” Everyone in the room stood up
from their seats, about to applaud. “Wait! Wait! I’m not done. Sit back down.”
Everyone sat down. “I declare total war on Europe, their allies and associates!
I declare that the one to deliver this offer of battle to General Gustafson
shall be…Hollow Water, ambassador to Europe.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                            
</span>“Hold on, Chief. Is he even available? I’ve never seen him in the fort
before,” asked Blood Drawer. <span

he is,” replied Blue Potato. The door opened, and Hollow Water stepped into the
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                           
</span>“Here I am,” he said. “I accept your mission, Chief. As for my limited
appearances, I’ve spent most of my time reading famous works of literature and
novels, looking at quotations, and strengthening my vocabulary. By doing all
that in my quarters, I’ve left the home very little. <span class=GramE>So</span>
it makes sense why you’ve rarely seen me.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

make us proud by inviting Gustafson to a battle. Please have him show up on the
plains just north of here, near the deserted farmhouse, on May 5<sup>th</sup>.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>In the early hours of April 28<sup>th</sup>, Hollow
Water approached the walls of Fort Ottawa, closely followed by 50 bodyguards,
including Hiawatha. Telling his guards to stay behind, he rode up alone to the
gate, accompanied only by an interpreter, carrying a white flag so that the
Europeans would not fire at him. One of the sentries on the wall yelled down:
“Who goes there?” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                          </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                            </span>“It

</span>The two sentries on the wall held a whispered conversation for a minute,
then the first one who had spoken dropped down out of sight. Fifteen minutes
later, a side door opened. Two <span class=GramE>large</span>, strongly-built
men who Hollow Water recognized as police officers walked out and began patting
down and searching the two natives. After two minutes of sifting through their
clothes and hair, the officers stood aside and allowed General Gustafson to
pass. Three servants placed a wooden table and three stools down between the
three men. Behind the general stood the two police officers and 3 tall,
muscular Russian Imperial guards. Gustafson asked the interpreter if he and the
ambassador would like a drink. “He would like to know if you want a beverage,
sir,” said the translator.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                     
</span>“No, no, I’m good,” replied Hollow Water, making a “no” sign with his
hands. Gustafson smiled, and then turned to the interpreter. “How about you, my
friend? Do you desire anything to drink?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                             
</span>“I’ll have a cup of coffee, thank you,” said the interpreter. Gustafson
called a servant over and requested a glass of orange juice and coffee, and
then returned to the conversation. “Now then,” started Hollow Water, “I am here
to deliver this message to you.” He pulled out a scroll from his pocket. “Blue
Potato kindly invites you to do battle with his army on the plains just
southwest of here, about 2 miles northeast of Fort Toronto, with the farmhouse.
As men of honor, he says he will not conduct any trickery, nor will there be
any surprises. He asks that you oblige to do the same, and may the best man
win. Do feel free to bring along your finest troops and generals.”<span

Water returned back to base at a slow gallop in a very jolly mood. Hiawatha was
perplexed at his attitude, but refrained from commenting. Upon entering the

artillerymen. With the help of the farmer, they were able to save most of the
guns. Currently, the police and a few thousand of the major city garrisons are
out scouring the countryside for the would-be-saboteurs. Would you mind lending
a couple hundred of your Berlin officers for this manhunt?”<span

walked over to the front of the room and pulled down a scroll. “As one can see
on this map of the battlefield, our side slopes down with a cliff in the
middle, where the headquarters will be based. On both sides of the field are
densely packed forests. The natives have created two large, hard to penetrate
redoubts on both sides of the farmhouse. It will not be easy to assault them. Our
cannons shall be placed all across our line. Hopefully, the angle of the slopes
are high enough so that when the guns fire they do not hit our own men. Our
cavalry will be positioned on the ends of the front. We can assume where the
natives will place their men and robbed cannons by intelligence reports and
data analysis, but it is uncertain where their cavalry shall be. Does anyone
have any ideas as to how we should assault the redoubts? We are not going to
just throw our men against them over and over and hope our numbers prevail.
There are two large ponds in the middle of the field which might prove to be a
hindrance.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>               </span>“What is the

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                      </span>“Theirs,
being higher quality, can reach probably up to the edge of the pond nearest

and then stay idle. Let them make the first move. We have every reason to wait.
On the other hand, the natives need to reach a conclusion quickly or they’ll be
forced to either surrender or die. They’ve only got two seasons left before
winter, and then when the cold and starvation kicks in…they’ll be regrettting
not facing us earlier.”<span

"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>May 5<sup>th</sup>, 1802. Blue Potato
was in his headquarters on the cliff. Dawn was just breaking over the horizon.
He exited his tent and took out his spyglass. The Europeans had not arrived
yet. His native army was already setting up defenses. Atop the redoubts, artillerymen
prepared the cannons and set down ammunition. On the fields below, troops put
down stakes to repel cavalry. The native horsemen themselves were in hiding
within the thick woodland on both sides, taking the utmost care to remain
silent. At the same time, other men were getting in position inside the
farmhouse. Blood Drawer had handpicked the strongest and most dedicated troops
to guard it. Men removed the glass on the windows so that their muskets could
fire through them and a several torches were brought in, along with a pot of
oil, so that when the Europeans reached the entrance the boiling hot liquid
could be poured down upon them. To conserve the limited supply of firearms and
ammunition, only the troops at the window were equipped with muskets. Everyone
else wielded either a sword, dagger, or axe. General Hiawatha was placed in
control of the center, including the farmhouse. Blood Drawer was in charge of
the two flanks and Blue Potato in overall command. He had sent a messenger to
Bone Wrangler and Shark Bull for help at the beginning of the siege, in late
March. Over a month later, there had been no response. Since the messenger had
been sent on the most dangerous route, by ship across Lake Erie, there was ever
reason to suspect that he had been killed by the European gunners. Still, Blue
Potato secretly thought that, just maybe, one of the two commanders had been
able to break the blockade and was on his way with an army. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Meanwhile, in Europe, the situation
was not looking good. The Emperor and his commanders were away in Europe,
leaving Prime Minister Joppel Toth as head of state. The crowd of protestors in
Berlin had grown from about 40 to nearly 400. Unfortunately, since a few
thousand Berlin police officers had been sent to North America with the
emperor, the couple hundred remaining were not sufficient to keep back the
crowd. The protestors, angry at how the government, especially Emperor
Phillips, had not fulfilled its promises, began vandilizing homes and
businesses across the city. 20 people in the mob, on May 2<sup>nd</sup>,
manuevered to an area where there were no officers and made a run for city
hall. Only one guard stood between them and the entrance. The civilians easily
cut him down with their fists and stormed in. It took just a minute for them to
locate the mayor’s office. Mayor Arnold Emmerich was working at his desk when
the crowd broke inside. He grabbed a pistol kept inside his desk for
emergencies and fired. One man was felled but the rest continued towards him.
Emmerich was cornered, but fought, using the butt of his gun as a club, to the
very end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>The following day, Sokolov, the
justice minister, called out the German militia to restore order. Since Berlin
had proved especially rowdy, he stationed the most troops there, 1,200 in
total, compensating for the loss of the policemen. Sokolov had also received
reports that a large lot of protestors in Paris had been inspired by the
Berliners and were gathering in front of the military headquarters every
morning. Luckily, the chances of an assault succeeding were unlikely, as the
complex was guarded by 2,500 troops at all times, but nevertheless the justice
minister gave the police strict orders to execute by the end of the month: “Rid
the city of these unruly ruffians by words, or force if you must.” On May 11<sup>th</sup>,
the mob of nearly 8,000 was confronted by a combined force of police and
militia numbering close to 2,000. The comissioner bellowed out the order:
“Leave now or we will open fire! I repeat, leave now or we will open fire!” But
the crowd would not litsen. Ten minutes later, they were still shouting and
chanting their discontent. Finally, the comissioner declared that it was time. The
first line of officers raised their muskets and fired. Twenty civilians were
killed instantly and many more wounded. There were screams heard and the crowd
began to scatter. The first line of police kneeled to reload while the second
fired. Just two minutes later, the streets were clear. All that remained were
the dead bodies and blood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:

to arrive at the battlefield. General Elias Gustafson is their commander. He
plants the flag of Europe at the very tip of the cliff. Then he heads back
several hundred feet to the headquarters. “Mr. Ivanov, please oversee the
preparation of our defenses and artillery setup while I converse with Mr. Weber
here.” <span

European forces labored for the next hour on planting their own stakes,
assembling the artillery, handing out arms and ammunition, setting up the headquarters
and tents and flattening the ground. The cooks and servants, of which there
were several hundred, began to prepare the 2<sup>nd</sup> breakfast of the
morning (the first had been served around five). At 8:02, the head chef blew a
trumpet, and all the soldiers lined up to receive their meal: sausages, an
omelet, a scoop of fried potatoes, and optional corn bread all on a plate and
served with a side of cold water or coffee for officers and above. Gustafson
was not hungry due to his anxiousness at the coming battle and took only 3
bites of an apple before washing it down with a sip of wine. Breakfast had
wrapped up by 8:55, and the battle opened a few minutes later with Blue Potato
lighting the first cannon shot. The cannonball soared over the field and smashed
into the hardended, dry dirt of the field. Although the natives expected some
sort of a response, Gustafson ordered his men to do nothing but wait. Blue
Potato, suspcious, simply sat down on a stool and did the same. But twenty
minutes later, he realized what was really happening and told Blood Drawer to
lead 2 light cavalrydivisions in an initial charge against the European left
flank. The chief hoped to have the cavalry soften that flank, and then follow
it up with waves of infantry and heavy cavalry assualts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Gustafson, who had been writing out a
letter to his mother in his tent, was startled was Weber opened the flap and
cried: “Elias, they’re moving!” The general ran out of the tent and looked up. The
enemy cavalry was indeed racing towards them. Gustafson<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>immediately shouted for Ivanov. “Maxim! Get
those infantry in square! Now!” He then turned to the artillerymen. “Have those
guns loaded and firing this second! The enemy is approaching!” Troops all over
the front scrambled to get into position and the gunners frantically got their
cannons ready. Boom! Boom! Boom! Several cannonballs were launched against the
cavalry with devestating effect. The natives continued to race towards them,
however. They were hit hard by musket fire coming from the infantry squares. The
cavalry charged straight into the squares and began engaging in close combat
with the squares. Following not far behind were 9,000 native infantry. About
half carried muskets, most of them abandoned by or stolen from the Europeans,
but a few sent from Africa. The rest were all equipped with heavy battle axes,
spears or swords. On the infantry’s flank were 2,000 heavy cavalry, composed of
stronger men wielding grander weapon and larger horses than the light. Astoundingly,
none of Blue Potato’s troops present, not even the heavy cavalry considered his
best soldiers on the field, wore body armor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Just as the chief had hoped, by 10PM
the light cavalry divisions had drawn the Europeans’ attention to their left
flank. It therefore came as a surprise when the native warriors focused their
attack on the right. The heavy cavalry managed to break through the first line
of defenses and were about to reach the artillery emplacements, only to be
deterred by a hasty last-minute charge of some 1,500 French lancers, directed
by Gustafson himself. The European commander was in the thick of the fighting
on the right flank, and later some of the artillerymen, being witnesses, would
say that had it not been for his bold leadership the enemy horsmen would have
breached the defenses. The heavy cavalry were closely trailed by 4 infantry
battalions, which fought determinedly against the lancers atop the slope. After
the heavy cavalry had been routed on the right flank, Gustafson decided to
spare some losses among his lancers and ordered them to scatter. The native
troops behind them were delighted, thinking they were fleeing, and sprinted
forward only to be greeted by several rounds of grapeshot. It was the end for
them, and the natives turned around, not to stop running until they reached the
safety of their camp. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Blue Potato, watching everything
through his spyglass while sitting on the cliff, had a frown on his face. He
had lost a divison of heavy cavalry, two divisions of light cavalry and more than
a few squadrons of infantry. The assault on the right flank which he had such
high hopes for had been deterred by Gustafson’s abrupt arrival. His troops were
fighting hard on the left flank, where the battle swung back and forth. Now, at
11AM, the Chief decided to send General Hiawatha with another 5,000 warriors
against the left flank to keep up the pressure. However, the advancing troops
caught Gustafson’s attention. Waiting for all the native forces to be packed
into one mass fighting the European squares, Gustafson then launched 12,000
heavy cavalry under Weber’s command to sorround the horde. He was successful in
trapping the native troops behind two large European divisions. It became a
giant slaughter as Blue Potato’s men struggled to escape; most failed and were
put to the sword. Within 15 minutes, thousands of freshly killed native bodies
coated the field. Between 10-20 had managed to flee and survive. Blue Potato,
who had watched the scene through his spyglass, was devestated. The battle was
going horribly. He decided to stop the assaults and have everyone retire for
lunch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>The native troops, already suffering
from low morale due to a string of defeats during the morning, were not at all
thrilled to discover that their “lunch” was, due to the European blockade, simply
a slice of goat cheese with bread, a spoonful of roast beef, a handful of
grapes and water from the fortress wells. On the other hand, the Europeans
lunched on luxurious meals cooked by the army’s professional chefs. Choices for
the troops, according to diaries and portions of official records, included:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

were welcome to help themselves to beer and cold water, and due to a surprlus
of food supplies from the transports coming from Europe every soldier was
permitted a small second helping if desired. Gustafson himself, in a very good
mood, ordered the first selection and after finishing his gelato slurped down
two more bowls of pea soup. It was a hearty meal and afterwards most of the
European troops had stuffed themselves silly, along with Gustafson himself. Ivanov
was one of the only Europeans who had ate light and strolling through the camp
at one on his horse shook his head in disbelief. Nearly all the soldiers were
drunk or taking a nap on the grass. Half an hour later, the situation had not
improved. Ivanov, taking matters into hand, began galloping through the
European camp, blowing a horn while two of his subordinates followed on
horseback, banging pots and pans together to make as much noise as possible. It
was not long before everyone had awakened to find three massive native forces
quickly advancing towards them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Maxim? I’m trying to get a nap. That was one delicious lunch—”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                            </span>“Elias! The natives
are attacking and everyone is asleep! We need our leader, now!” Just as
Gustafson’s eyes widened with alarm, Ivanov forcefully pulled him out of the tent
and into the sunlight. Blue Potato’s troops had indeed reached the bottom of
the slope. A not fully awake Gustafson failed to take note that, strangely,
only one line of native troops had come up this far. The remainder were waiting
far behind, just out of reach of the artillery. He did, however, issue orders
to his men. “Get those cannons pounding! Maxim! Bring the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
heavy cavalry divisions to the front! Weber, lead the 5<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>
and 9<sup>th</sup> line infantry divisions here immediately!” Just as he had
expected, the first line of natives broke and ran, and the rest of their
attacking forces similarly began retreating. Gustafson immediately ordered
Ivanov to pursue with his cavalry, but he had made a mistake in sending heavy
instead of light cavalry. Abruptly, 3 battalions of native horsemen charged out
of the forest and engaged Ivanov’s divisions, preventing them from being able
to pursue. The cavalry battle was to rage for hours on the edges of the
tear-shaped pond as both sides sent reinforcements. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Meanwhile, Gustafson ordered at 1PM
for Weber to lead 3 infantry divisions against the farmhouse in the deep center
of the native line. It was guarded by artillery on both sides, and the twin
redoubts. To keep the slingers, javelinists and musketmen atop the first
redoubt busy, Gustafson sent in the elite Austrian jäger battalion commanded by
captain Franz Müller. For the second one, he hesitantly ordered Commissioner
Felix Fusch to assault it with his Berlin officers. It took a grueling 80
minutes for the European forces to reach the base of the redoubts, and after
passing the larger of the two ponds (they purposely avoided the other for fear
of being entangled in the cavalry fight) the native artillery opened up on
them. As soon as they passed the pond, Weber’s men began running in order to
avoid as much of the bombardment as they could. Luckily, Blue Potato had the
finest guns but lacked the operators, and therefore the rate of fire was slow
and inaccurate. Soon, after suffering not too many losses, Weber reached the
center of the native line. While Fusch’s officers handled the right redoubt and
the jägers the left, General Weber ran his infantry straight up to the
farmhouse. As the troops neared, native musketmen in and outside the farmhouse
fired several volleys at the Europeans, taking out many. But Weber’s men kept
on coming, and the divisions crashed straight into the farmhouse door, which
was both bolted and barricaded. Blood Drawer, who was in command of the
farmhouse, ordered 900 warriors, carrying longswords and axes, to attack. Surprising
the Europeans, they initially pushed them back several feet. Hand-to-hand
combat ensued, leaving Weber at a serious disadvantage because the native
musketmen continued to pour fire on them from the second story. But his men
pressed on, and eventually they routed the warriors. His infantrymen charged
into the farmhouse and engaged the troops inside in a very fierce battle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

pond are both areas of extreme, prolonged combat. The cavalry battle carries on
as Blue Potato and Gustafson both send more and more of their best horsemen
into the fight. Weber struggles to force himself into the farmhouse, but for
now the natives have been successful in keeping them out. Although the
Europeans could use artillery against the cavalry and the natives the Europeans
at the farmhouse, neither will for fear of hitting their own men. With both
areas covered by his two best and highes-ranking commanders, Gustafson feels
secure and turns away from the field. He calls a meeting in the dining hall

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                                                    </span>“Why,
Blue Potato, of course. If he is taken out, the remainder of the enemy army
will surely collapse with him.” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>            </span>“How should we take him out, sir?”
asked Leroy. “I’m unable to find an open route where we could just rush up and
kill him.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                 
</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                              </span>“Yes,
the native headquarters is inconveniently located just behind the farmhouse,”
replied Gustafson, who stood up and pulled out a large scroll from his coat
pocket, which turned out to be a map. Pointing to it, he said: “We need to
somehow get past all those defenders, which won’t be easy. They’ve got these
huge redoubts on both sides and although going through the farmhouse is the
most straightforward, it’s simply impenetrable. I’m not sure about going around
either, since chances are they’ve got reserves behind the redoubts that we just
can’t see, and I’d hate for our elite assassins to run into those. Your
highness, have you any ideas?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                         
</span>“As a matter of <span class=GramE>fact</span> I do,” started the
emperor. “Samuel, why don’t you and your boys dress up in native garb and
pretend to be servants for the chief? That way you can get near him, hopefully
in his tent. Then, when it’s safe, stick your knife through him and the job is
done. Make a run for it and we’ll be waiting for you.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                        </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                </span>“I’m not too
sure about this, General,” said Leroy. “I’d rather just work on defeating their
army. I don’t know if killing their Chief is the best way to go about this…”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>An hour later, Leroy and his group of
agents were on horseback, riding through the thick forest, trying to get behind
native lines. Just as they got off their saddles and approcahed the camp, a
Dakota sentry stopped them. “Excuse me, but what are you doing?” he asked
angrily. “Why were you in the forest? You look like servants to me. There’s no
business for you to be conducting in there.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                                  
</span>Leroy winked to one of the agents, indicating that they were all to go
along with the plan now, as the guard was fooled by their attire and face
paint. He then began speaking in heavily accented Dakota language. “We was
trying to find food for the Chief, but was unable locate any. We are going back
to him to apologize. Do let us in please.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>               </span>“Hmm…what’s with the accents?
I’ve never heard of any funny-sounding peoples like you before…where are you
all from?”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                             </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                               </span>“Please,”
said Leroy, “just allow us to enter. We must apologize to the Chief.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                  </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                    </span>“Fine,
but that shouldn’t take too long, should it? I’m just gonna hold this one here
hostage,” said the sentry as he snapped his fingers, “until you return. I’ll
give you 10 minutes, how about that?” Another guard appeared and ushered one of
the agents away with his spear. “If you don’t show up right here on time, this
one gets it.”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                   
</span>With that, the guard left and as soon as he was out of earshot, Leroy
turned to his agents. “Boys, we’ve got to find the Chief’s tent, quickly, or
otherwise our pal there gets a knife in his ribs. Let’s go. Follow my lead.” <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                               </span>Leroy began
walking towards a tent several yards away. He assumed it was Blue Potato’s
since it had two guards on the outside and a flag flying beside it. His men
followed. As they had all expected, once Leroy got within two feet of the tent
one of the guards stopped him. “Whoa there. What do you think you’re doing? Who
are you?”<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                   
</span>“We are servants. We come to apologize to Chief because we was unable to
find food for Chief. Please let us in.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>               </span>“Gee, your speaking skills are
rubbish. I can’t believe you were hired to work for us. Ah well, I guess I can
let you in if my buddy here supervises. But I’ll let have to inspect you first.
Come over here.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                               
</span>“Why you got to inspect us?” asked Leroy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                     </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                                      </span>“So
we can make sure you ain’t carrying no weapons of any sort.” The guard reached
to Leroy and began to pat him down, but just as he was about to feel the
dagger, Leroy pulled it out and in one lightning-fast movement, sliced off the
guard’s hand. “AAAAIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!” he screamed in pain, jumping
backwards and tripping over a stone. “Luca!” he cried. “Get them, now!” The
other guard took out his sword and jumped Leroy, engaging them in a wrestling
match. The other agents were stunned for a moment but then sprung into action.
Two of them joined in to free Leroy from the guard while the rest entered the
tent. They were all killed instantly by a whiff of grapeshot. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>“I am most humbled at your
improvisation, Shark Bull,” remarked Blue Potato. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                    </span>“I’m
flattered, Chief,” he replied, “but really, it wasn’t that difficult. We just
appeared on the other side of the camp, discovered that you were being
threatened, and so we tried to make as little noise as possible while
approaching your tent and informing you of the situation. Luckily, the fight at
the farmhouse and the assassins’ combat with your guards were loud enough to
cover your escape and your replacement by a cannon. It was already loaded, so
we just waited for them to open the flap. When they did, well, it was all over.”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                            
</span>“I have to say, Shark Bull, for such an astonishing and impressive feat,
saving my life, you may have very well earned yourself some rewards, maybe even
a promotion. I owe you dearly, General. But first—”<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                         
</span>“Yes. Don’t worry, Chief, I’ll have this battle wrapped up in no time.”
Immediately, he jumped on his horse and galloped off to lead his army.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>                                                                                                                                                                                  
</span>“Men,” Shark Bull cried. “We are now to send those Europeans packing.
Musketmen, begin firing at the enemy troops sorrounding the farmhouse. Cavalry,
ambush those jägers on the right. Warriors, fight off the policemen on the
left. Let’s move, move move!”<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Gustafson was on his way to the
front, ready to rally his troops on, when he saw what was happening. It was
obvious that the assassionation attempt had failed. But now what was going on?
The Berlin officers, who he had reinforced with two battalions of line
infantry, were falling back from the redoubts, struggling to fight off a new
group of hardened native warriors. The jägers were all of a sudden charged by
several hundred native light cavalry. How foolish he had been for not ordering
Müller to plant stakes on all sides! Gustafson cursed quietly, but there was
nothing that could be done now. Both flanks were now routing. It was too late
to have the center retreat…hopefully Weber and at least a reasonable portion of
his men managed to flee safely. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Gustafson quickly raced back to his
headquarters and gave the most feared order for a general retreat along the
entire front. However, Ivanov persuaded him to try one last time for a victory.
The Russian Imperial Guard was sent in, along with 8,000 more infantry whose
formations still remained completely intact. The Guards started off at a walk
towards the native lines, and managed to advance 35 yards beyond the ponds, 45
yards, 55 yards, nearly reaching the redoubts! The Imperial Guard, being the
most elite and respected of all the European troops on the field that day,
continued their walk despite losing many to the ferocious native artillery
fire. But when they came within range of the native muskets, everything fell
apart. The Russians suffered over 200 casualties in just a few seconds at
first. They were able to successfully fire a few volleys of their own in
response, and felled many natives lined up below the redoubts. But soon, they
were having their ranks filled by common line infantry, and 20 minutes later,
it all fell apart. Paul Saminov, the Guard’s captain, stayed behind with his
men and fought to the very end, allowing the rest of the army of make a hasty
escape. Although the Guard’s accompanying infantry fled before long, it is said
that not a single one of the Russian Imperial Guard lived after that day. 10
years after the battle, Gustafson would declare while honoring their offical
memorial in Moscow that the unit was not to ever be revived, because no soldiers,
no matter how qualified, could ever replace those who fatefully died that day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Blue Potato and his men were beyond
ecstatic. He decided to first take care of the bodies that night and clean up
the battlefield, then begin a week’s worth of celebrations the following afternoon
at 5PM. The next day, on May 6<sup>th</sup>, proved very busy for the head
chef, Buffalo Rider, who oversaw a massive cooking session as over 900 cooks
prepared thousands of dishes for the entire army present at Fort Toronto that
day. This was made much easier by the fact that the Europeans had begun pulling
out their blockade, and in the process had stated that they would not attack
any native ships traveling through the Great Lakes. Blue Potato, exhuasted from
the previous day, had ruled to stay in the underground bunker until the start
of the celebration. He slept through the entire morning, ate lunch, then wrote
in his diary and read one of his favorite books until 4:30. Stepping out of his
quarters, he was astonished to see an incredibly busy scene. Buffalo Rider was
supervising the prepartion of a gigantic pot of stew. Multiple jumbo bowls of
guacamole, baked beans, smoked salmon, and fried potatoes with onions were
brought out as appetizers until dinner was served at 7. It was to be a grand
week of celebrations. The Chief was scheduled to open and conclude the
celebrations, and deliver an opening address, also the victory speech, starting
at 6:40 and lasting until dinnertime. For the following 6 days, there would be
games, a ceremony for those who died, anti-European rallies and events, mass
entertainment in the Dakota capital of Eropet, a mock reconstruction of the
battle on the same site, and plays held in the courtyard of Fort Toronto, many
of which were classics by European and native playwrights (of course, any
offenses to natives were ommitted). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Meanwhile, Gustafson had retreated
with the remains of his army back to Fort Ottawa. From there, he boarded his
flagship, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Northumberland</i>. He then
ordered the ship to sail back to Europe. His top advisors protested, saying it
would be very bad for his public image if he just took off without warning, and
leaving the emperor behind, but the general, depressed and with a blurred mind,
did not listen. Amazingly, he did even bother to order escorts, and simply left
into the Atlantic, with only 150 or so guards/gunners aboard. The ship was not
even at full strength, but Gustafson did so anyway. Emperor Phillips, hearing
of his abrupt departure a few days later, was perplexed and nonplussed. He
eventually decided that he would follow him, and discuss the failure with him
and the general’s staff. Although he did not share his thoughts with anyone,
and only jotted down brief passages in his diary (which he kept sealed up in a
secret location), the emperor privately believed that Gustafson was not solely
responsible for the defeat, nor did even the majority of the blame fall on him.
He thought the most important aspect of the fight that day had been conducted
in an area far from the battlefield itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

feeling well. A European agent had planted a bomb inside the <i

traveling in the Red Sea en route to South Africa. Most of the passengers aboard
had survived with only minor injuries, but the king had been launched off the
ship and landed on the deck of an escort vessel. He had suffered a fractured
leg, several snapped ribs and a chipped tooth. Royal guards had the king sailed
to a nearby inn, and 20 messengers were sent out to search for a doctor. A
local farmer informed them that a very qualified doctor was available in
Djbouti, only 15 miles away, but by then Ubinu had already lost a significant
amount of blood. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

would capture Ottawa and Montréal, then maintain that position for 8 months. In
the spring of 1803 they would launch several simultaneous attacks, confuse the
Europeans and win Québec. Soon the war would all be over. However, Blood Drawer
had decided that for it to have the greatest chance of success, the Africans’
help would be required. Unfortunately, at the moment, the chances of the
Africans providing support were not promising. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

always follow in their footsteps and double-cross them as well. They can help
us in our invasion of Mexico. Once we have North America under our heel, we can

generals Shark Bull and Blood Drawer abruptly charged in with their heavy
infantry, who were all mounted on horseback, enabling them to move quicker. From
two sides of the fort, they attacked with lightning speed. To demoralize the
enemy even further, Blue Potato had ordered his archers to fire high so that
their arrows would fall straight onto the Europeans’ heads. He had also told
the head of the archer training barracks, who was present, to launch a flaming
arrow at the European flag, which he did. The burning enemy flag encouraged the
natives on but sent several of the European sentries, panic-stricken, to make a
run for it. The soldiers inside were taken completely by surprise. It was only

prisoners being kept inside, replaced the ruined European flag with his own
standard, and rounded up all the enemy personnel, to be sent away to Mexico,
far down south, where he believed that they would be kept far from the
fighting. All weapons in usable condition were carefully stockpiled in crates,
as muskets and their ammunition were hard to find. Blue Potato immediately sent
a messenger to General Hiawatha in Fort Toronto, asking him to send another
20,000 men.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

The emperor wants you to do it, so you’ll do it. Gentlemen, let’s go over the
plan once more. We have 5 divisions, a total of 125,000 men, conducting an
amphibious landing on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. Each division has its
own battalions of artillery and cavalry. The newly appointed Vice Admiral
Xavier Cardoso will be in charge of the navy, and Major general Maxim Ivanov
here will lead the armies. Generals Weis and Jorgenson, you will be his accompanying
subordinates. Our scouts report that the Gulf has only one naval base with a
very small assortment of ships, so we are only sending 9 escorts. Ivanov’s men
shall swiftly land on the beaches, then raid the nearby villages. The goal for
this year is to capture the regional capital of San Luis. In order to make the
natives to feel threatened enough to send a decent amount of their forces
south, we have to attack a major city. Veracruz and Monterrey could also work,
but I feel that San Luis is the most straightforward. This is where the
Africans come in. While we stay at San Luis, they will head north and ambush
the native army marching south. The native force will be annahilated. The
natives will have to send more and more men down to deal with this new, greater
threat. Meanwhile, we shall be sending an army to Canada to take back what is
rightfully ours.”<span

Egyptian law enforcement officers, who conducted their business professionally

General Liam Weis and his fleet reached land. Having been blown off course

Panama, more than a thousand miles south of its destination. This error was not
immediately clear to Weis and his subordinates, who had never been to Mexico

region unpleasantly hot and humid but were able to live off, for a while, the
plentiful fruit growing in it. Nine days later, European scouts foraging for

font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;mso-no-proof:yes'>Back in Britain, the
emperor was taking a short trip home to see his children and extended family.
He had insisted that his twin sons and daughter, who were still in secondary
school, not accompany him to Berlin once he became emperor to minimize the
interrution to their education. Consequently, he had not spent any time with
them in person since ascending to the throne. Since European intelligence was
sensing stirrings of discontent among the population, however, Phillips decided
he could not afford to wait — he needed to reassure his fellow Europeans and
instill confidence in the war effort. After lunching with his children and
taking them horseback riding, the emperor arranged for a sit-down interview
with the editor of Europe’s state-run newspaper, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The Liberator</i>. Woodrow Webster, who also served as the deputy
minister of propaganda, was a master of illusion. Even though everything
printed in the newspaper was subjected to multiple layers of censorship, and
all of its interviews were scripted down to the last letter, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The Liberator</i> maintained a loyal
readership whose members never doubted its legitimacy and accuracy. This
conversation with Phillips would be no different; and both the emperor and
Webster knew it, but the transcript that went to print would appear as natural
as possible. Webster had already written in advance a sycophantic editorial
that would lavish praise upon Phillips for his leadership. For the sake of
establishing witnesses, the two would meet in person on September 20 at the
outdoor pavillion of the Edinburgh town hall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:115%;

emperor replied as he walked over to Webster and shook his hand. The crowd,
approximately 200 local residents, applauded. They were cordoned about 12 feet
from the stage by a long line of elaborately dressed soldiers, but no troops
would be shown in any etchings of the event. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

quickly and businesses were able to return to their offices and residents were
able to return to their homes within a short period of time. I would be remiss,

our dependence on weapons imports. As we speak, our armies and navies continue

after your interview with Colonel Stanley, the weather turns sour. You, as well
as the rest of your regiment, are forced to lodge in Quebec for a few weeks. It
is not until mid-April of 1808 that you and your men learn your next
assignment: <span class=GramE>the</span> Third Swiss Army is to embark on a
journey west to the Five Lakes, and then join seven other European armies in a
joint attack on Fort Toronto and the surrounding towns. Emboldened by his
latest success, you presume, Field Marshal Gustafson is bringing together nearly
all the troops he can muster to strike straight at the native field
headquarters. It is a risky operation, but if executed properly it could very
well end the war. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

have a hard time settling into your new role, which you soon find out is a
position manufactured by Colonel Stanley for him to leave all his unwanted
tasks to you. Although you report directly to the Colonel, you are frequently left
out of the most important deliberations. While he discusses strategy with
Captain Stevenson and Staff Sergeant Ricardo, more often than not you are stuck
in your office inspecting muskets or procuring the next week’s rations. At
least you now know why Field Marshal Gustafson was not at the emperor’s
reception. As Assistant Colonel, you are responsible for processing the
Colonel’s mail, a duty which allows you to gain many insights from his
correspondence with the Imperial Office. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

turns out the massive native defeat came with a silver lining: they had been routed
on the field, but as the native soldiers scattered they came upon European
supply wagons like predators to prey. Isolated and insufficiently guarded, crate
after crate of packed goods and ammunition were seized by the natives. The
emperor was furious, and assigned Gustafson to personally restore the supply
lines. The wagons were now to travel in groups of five, each protected by nine privates
and a corporal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

rapid rise within the army brings with it both admirers and enemies. You
receive an array of letters from family and friends back in Switzerland
overjoyed at the news of your promotion, but your own men are not so pleased. The
idea of a 23-year-old as a colonel’s second-in-command is practically unheard
of, and hardly any troops take your orders seriously. One night, you return
from a foraging mission only to find your tent in flames. By the time the fire
is put out, all your belongings have been reduced to charred ashes. You want to
hunt down your would-be murderer, but the Colonel assures you he will handle
it. Not wanting to be reprimanded for disobedience, you spend your spare
evenings reading up on news from Europe and spending the earnings from your
increased salary on a new horse. Anyhow, you don’t have time to worry about petty
grudges. Your regiment is about to enter the vicinity of the Five Lakes: native
territory. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

take advantage of his momentarily lapse to thrust your sabre into his chest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

reason, you must capture him. You reach for your musket and aim for his horse. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sergeant Marcian tackling the native axeman. He may have just saved your life,
but you cannot thank Marcian now: Bone Wrangler has pulled out a pistol, and
you are his target.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and when you do you are greeted by the sight of Bone Wrangler being disarmed by
