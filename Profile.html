		To a newcomer at South, physics teacher Ryan Normandin probably looks more like a student
		than a teacher — a college intern at most. When freshmen enter his classroom on the first day,
		they think he’s one of them. When he checks out a book from the library, the librarian asks him
		for his student ID. When he buys lunch in the Student Center, the cashier asks him to enter his
		ID number.
		<p>
		It’s a forgivable mistake. Appearance aside, Normandin still resembles those he teaches. He
		has never been a South student in name, but in many ways, he is a student in practice. At age
		25, Normandin is one of the youngest teachers in the building, and also one of the most unique.
		Even though he’s no longer in their shoes, he easily connects with his students, freshmen and
		seniors alike. He happened to be starting a new unit on the day I was there. “We’re doing work
		today,” he announced at the start of class to get the ball rolling (work is a concept in physics).
		“Watt is the unit of power?” he later asked. At one point, he abruptly turned and asked everyone
		in the room: “Quick survey: out of curiosity, do you circle or box your answers?” Puns, jokes,
		and tangents like these go a long toward energizing the room and making him a more relatable
		figure, but for Normandin, they’re not enough.
		<p>
		In his ideal classroom, he said, students feel comfortable above all. When he saw that the
		members of his A block class this year were interacting more with their phones than they were
		with each other, he took the unusual step of scheduling unstructured time during several blocks
		just so his students could get to know each other better.
		<p>
		In other classes, he will set aside 10 or 15 minutes at the start of every Monday for everyone
		to share stories from his or her weekends. Even on a regular day, he doesn't stand at the front of
		the room for long, and his students don't sit for long in their seats. “While some of the times he
		is the focal point of the attention, he’s usually running an effective discussion, so it’s not just
		him standing and delivering information,” according to science department head Gerard
		Gagnon, who occasionally observes Normandin’s classes. “He’s also often soliciting student
		responses, and then he gives students the opportunity to dig into it on their own or with
		partners.”
		<p>
		Group work is integral in Normandin’s classes. He requires students to collaborate during
		class and strongly encourages collaborating on homework. I observed that his lectures
		comprised no more than half of each period, leaving students with ample time to solve practice
		problems together while he and his TAs (teacher assistants) walked around answering
		questions.
		<p>
		The effort Normandin puts into community-building pays off. After a few months, he told me,
		students are rarely afraid to speak their mind. His class monologues, frequently interspersed
		with questions and comments, quickly become dialogues, and Normandin often stays after the
		bell and after school talking with students, sometimes as late as 6pm.
		<p>
		Normandin’s exceptionally strong commitment to students indicates how, outside of a
		traditional classroom setting, he’s practically one of them. “When kids bring up exciting ideas
		and want to talk about those exciting ideas, they’re exciting to me too,” he said, “[since] I
		remember being one of those kids not that long ago, and I’m still that kid today. To me,
		[continuing the conversation beyond class] is natural. I can’t help myself.”
		<p>
		Normandin grew up in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, and unlike many of his peers, he says, he
		knew from the very beginning what his profession was going to be. “When I was in elementary
		school, I wanted to teach elementary school. When I was in middle school, I wanted to teach
		middle school. And when I was in high school, I wanted to teach high school,” he said.
		At Uxbridge High School, he became interested in science while learning about eccentric
		ideas like black holes and time travel, and applied to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of
		Technology) intending to major in physics. Only after failing his first physics course there,
		however, did he realize the flaws of his high school experience.
		<p>
		“The extent of [my high school physics] work was ‘here is an equation, here are some
		numbers, put them in,’” Normandin told me. “That was the level of the problems we did. It
		never varied from that, and that was it.” Having taken physics courses that were easy but did not
		prepare him for college, Normandin wants students to simultaneously avoid repeating his
		mistakes and understand what physics really is. “Physics is about relationships; it’s not about
		plugging numbers in. It’s about solving problems and critical thinking,” he said.
		<p>
		Indeed, Normandin’s kind and easygoing demeanor can belie the high standards he sets for
		them. Every Monday, he assigns his classes a problem set due in one week. These college-style
		problems, which are worth 30% of a student’s term grade, are deliberately challenging. His
		freshmen don’t need to solve problems of that difficulty to pass the physics MCAS
		(Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System); but Normandin’s expectations are not the
		same as the state’s. “I don’t think any class should be easy. If your class is easy, you’re not
		really learning anything,” he said. “I tell kids, ‘if you’re feeling uncomfortable and feeling
		challenged, that means you’re learning. It means I’m doing my job. It’s not a bad thing.’”
		<p>
		Counterintuitive as it may seem, his relaxed attitude and his challenging expectations aren’t at
		odds with each other — in fact, Normandin's classes can be challenging only because they are
		also relaxed. By building an encouraging environment in the classroom and establishing bonds
		among his students, he gives them room to fail and make mistakes, which ultimately gives them
		the extra time and support to be able to achieve at a higher level. According to Normandin, “if
		they were doing these really challenging problems with a teacher who is very, very rigid … that
		seems like it would be less effective.”
		<p>
		Aside from physics, Normandin enjoys teaching about political science. Passionate about the
		topic ever since he led a campaign to build a new high school in Uxbridge, he has taught
		college-level courses on various topics for high school students as part of MIT’s student-led
		ESP (Educational Studies Program). The courses ranged from covering American education
		policy to the financial collapse of 2008. Teaching at ESP while still in college, Normandin said,
		helped him develop his identity as an unconventional teacher before coming to South.
		<p>
		It was while at MIT that he created a Youtube series documenting his time as an
		undergraduate, “Life at MIT,” which has garnered nearly a million total views. During his first
		year at South, he spent hours after school reapplying those skills toward a new channel,
		NormandinEdu, which offers dozens of videos of Normandin himself teaching the same
		material he covers in his freshmen classes.
		<p>
		Since his courses are rigorous, he makes sure to provide as many resources as possible to
		students: besides their teacher and their textbook, they can consult a TA, whom Normandin
		employs in greater numbers than most other teachers, watch his Youtube videos, and ask and
		answer questions online on Piazza, an educational website similar to Schoology. Being
		responsible for nearly 100 students, “it’s almost unrealistic to expect that you’re going to be
		able to really get through to every single kid you’re teaching,” he told me. “I try to maximize
		my ability to do that by providing as many avenues as possible through which I can reach
		them.”
		<p>
		Normandin is one of thousands of teachers nationwide experimenting with the flipped
		classroom, a new model of pedagogy developed 9 years ago by two teachers at Woodland Park
		High School in Colorado, in which students watch lectures at home and work on their
		“homework” at school. Normandin, who according to Gagnon flips the classroom more than
		any other science teacher at South, will occasionally assign students to watch his Youtube
		videos at home so that they’re prepared to work on a new problem set during class. But even
		when he doesn’t formally flip the classroom, his students will still utilize the videos when they
		miss a class or don’t understand the material.
		<p>
		In addition, Piazza offers students a forum in which they can anonymously ask questions and
		answer those of their peers, while Normandin responds to the hardest ones left unanswered. He
		said he considers Piazza especially useful for students who aren’t inclined to speak up during
		class. “If it wasn’t anonymous, I wouldn’t get a third of the kids asking questions that I do,” he
		said. “They feel much more comfortable asking behind a screen.” Both Youtube and Piazza
		extend class beyond the classroom, which Normandin said helps students stay engaged even
		though he’s with them for only an hour every day.
		<p>
		One such student was senior Mitchell Gamburg, whom Normandin taught as a freshman and
		is now one of his TAs. “I think a lot of teachers shy away from using any type of online
		resources, and comparatively, it makes things a lot more difficult,” he said. “When you have
		that stuff accessible online, you can learn more, be able to reach it much faster, and
		communicate more freely.”
		<p>
		Gamburg’s judgment is reflected in the findings of multiple case studies in 2012 and 2014 at
		Minnesota’s Byron High School, Pennsylvania State University, and Texas A&M University, as
		reported in the educational publications Learning & Leading with Technology, Journal of
		Educational Technology and Society, and PRISM magazine. Working with more than 300
		students, educators in the three schools exposed students to new content by asking them to
		watch videos at home before practicing the skills in class. The amount of time spent on the trial
		varied, but in all three cases, student feedback was mostly positive, researchers documented a
		significant increase in student achievement, or both.
		<p>
		Normandin conducted his own case study while teaching his latest ESP class, “American
		Government Simulation,” which I had the opportunity to participate in during the summer of
		2014. Each student took on the role of a real congressman, lobbyist, or journalist for the
		duration of the six-week course — I was Wisconsin representative Paul Ryan — including a
		live mock congressional session during the last week of the class. I recall Ryan’s casual attitude,
		coupled with the course’s discussion-based, hands-on nature, as much more engaging than
		traditional classes.
		<p>
		Victor Liu, a senior at the Groton School and one of my classmates at the summer course,
		agreed that Normandin’s unconventional teaching style was an asset, saying he “really
		appreciated the opportunity that Mr. Normandin afforded every one of the members of his class
		to obtain a deeper understanding of how the government works from the perspective of an
		actual legislator.”
		<p>
		It would be difficult to teach a course in that format at South over an entire semester,
		Normandin said, but his interest in political science still manifests at the end of every year,
		when he hosts debates in his freshman classes after the MCAS. Past debate questions, which are
		often a blend of science and policy, include “Should the US continue funding nuclear fusion
		research?” and “Was the Iran nuclear deal a good deal?”
		The debates are another example of how Normandin’s teaching tools are uniquely tied to his
		personality. When reading student responses to his end-of-year surveys, he told me, one
		recurring piece of feedback that sticks with him is: “I hate physics as a subject, but I loved your
		class.”
		<p>
		Despite having a long road ahead of him, Normandin remains uncertain about what his future
		holds. “I’ve always wanted to teach, but I don’t think I’ve ever viewed teaching as the ending
		point,” he said. According to Normandin, that ending point could be an administrative role at
		South or running for elected office, but for the time being he is more than content to keep
		teaching. Acknowledging the strong and numerous connections he has built and will continue to
		build, he added, “the longer I’m here, the harder it becomes to leave. If I wanted to do
		something else, I’m giving something up as well, and the thing that I’m giving up is pretty
		great.”
