	<div class="content">
	The first world war was an epoch on many dimensions: legally, politically, and economically. Above all, the war marked a turning point for the art of war itself. Before the war, most societies considered warfare to be a dignified, natural phenomenon. After the war, warfare was redefined as inhumane and unacceptable. There are few better ways to understand the changing art of war than through the changing depiction of war through art. Through paintings and drawings, wartime artists captured the transformation of war from a noble institution into a savage undertaking during world war one. 
	<p>
	The Swiss historian Jean Jacques Babel once estimated that of 5,500 years of recorded history, only 292 were free of armed conflict (Axelrod 4). In general, political violence was remarkably common in the 19th century: the assassination of heads of state even became “a favored form of political protest” (Keister 12). Through 1815, most Europeans regarded war as “a regular, expected part of the rhythm of events” (Mueller 13). War had been condemned since antiquity but never truly dismissed (Wright 378).
	<p>
	Warfare was not merely accepted; it was venerated. Germany, more than any other belligerent in the first world war, revered war to the extent that the military and the state were almost inseparable. Germans were taught from a young age, by youth literature like the Jungdeutschland-Post, that “war is the most sublime and most holy expression of human activity” (Notestein and Stoll 35). “It is the soldier and the army, not parliamentary majorities and votes, that have welded the German Empire together,” the Kaiser once declared. “My confidence rests upon the army” (American Historical Association 462). Pre-war paintings echoed this sentiment upholding war as a morally sound endeavor. 
	<p>
	The perception of war was recorded not only in artwork, of course. The troops at the front also translated their thoughts verbally and orally. Yet since the American Civil War, soldiers had turned to art because it offered an opportunity to communicate feelings words alone could not convey (Conn 18). As one British lecturer put it in 1916, “language utterly fails to describe the glorious feats and magnificent heroisms of the great war, and I find words entirely inadequate to convey more than a faint expression of the deeds performed by thousands of men” (Fox 90). 
	<p>
	Greatness and glory were far more associated with artwork created before the war, however, than art created during the war itself. Contrasted with the art that emerged from world war one, the romanticization of battles in paintings prior to 1914 is striking. Among the myriad of media used to propagandize and emotionalize war, pictures are the quintessence of embellishment.
	<p>
	A critical feature of pre-war paintings is the glamorization of military figures, what James Loewen dubbed “heroification” (Loewen 11). Jacques-Louis David’s 1801 painting Napoleon Crossing the Alps naturally comes to mind, as does Benjamin West’s 1770 The Death of General Wolfe. This practice was common in artwork up to the start of the first world war. 
	<p>
	Augustus Tholey’s General Kearney's gallant charge at the Battle of Chantilly, Va., painted in 1867, is a prime example of art combining heroification with the dignified perception of battle. At the very center of the canvas is General Phillip Kearney, fearlessly charging straight into the enemy lines while the clouds part to shed light on him, as if to suggest Kearney has authority over nature itself. The large American flag flying right beside him, meanwhile, indicates his patriotism and love of country. His central location and surroundings, both in the background and the foreground, naturally command attention. Kearney’s actual death in action during the battle only reinforced this perception, turning him into a martyr for the Union cause. 
	<p>
	In addition to his portrayal of Kearney as larger than life, Foley underscores the notion of warfare as an organized affair. His painting is clearly divided into two sides, with Union soldiers forming a neat line on the left and Confederate soldiers on the right. This dichotomy defines the battle in terms of black and white, and implies that every belligerent belonged to one side or the other. The soldiers’ uniforms perpetuate this effect: since everyone wore either blue or gray, there was no ambiguity about who the opponent was. 
	<p>
	What Tholey’s painting downplayed is just as remarkable as what it highlighted. Tholey’s painting omits many of the attributes that characterized battle. There is no blood in the painting, despite there being several bodies lying on the ground and a Union soldier on the left who appears to have just been shot. It is especially odd that Tholey acknowledges — by means of the lightning bolt and dark clouds — the violent thunderstorm that erupted in the middle of the battle but does not actually show any rain drops or visual distortion that would have resulted from heavy precipitation. 
	<p>
	These qualities were not limited to the Western Hemisphere. As dozens of contemporary woodblock prints reveal, romanticization played a similar role in the first Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese print “Great Rear Attack by our Second Army at Weihaiwei,” created in 1895 by an unknown artist, serves as an Eastern counterpart to Tholey’s painting. 
	Some similarities, such as the flags and uniforms, are immediately apparent. Even though the flags in the print are smaller, there are far more of them. When supplemented with the bright red and blue Chinese uniforms, the scene becomes awash with color. The winter setting of the battle only augments the print’s vibrancy: were it not for the uniforms and flags contrasting with the snow, the canvas would simply be white.
	<p>
	Furthermore, the Japanese print validates the themes expressed in Tholey’s painting. Whereas Tholey depicted two armies about to do battle, the print depicts a battle in process. From the artist’s perspective, the colorful Japanese and Chinese flags and uniforms separate the action from chaos. Even though the armies’ formations have descended into scattered combat, the differences between the Japanese flags and Chinese pennants, along with their distinct attire, allow the artist to easily distinguish the soldiers of one side from those of the other. War in both the East and the West was unambiguous. 
	<p>
	The first world war symbolized a seismic shift in the representation of warfare. The war years witnessed a proliferation of avant-garde art which challenged conventional standards of artwork. Radical and innovative, the rise of these new types of modernist art coincided with and supplemented the transformation of war. Christopher Nevinson’s 1916 drawing Returning to the Trenches illustrates the changes simply yet effectively. 
	<p>
	To begin with, there are no flags or uniforms in his painting, making it difficult to tell which army the soldiers belong to. The lack of distinguishing features strips away the nationalism and patriotism that characterized the Japanese print and Tholey’s painting. The soldiers are not proudly marching into battle under their national banner, nor are they proudly displaying their national regalia. In contrast with the Japanese and American soldiers, the troops Nevinson depicts take little pride in their work. 
	<p>
	In addition to eliminating the soldiers’ national identity, Nevinson eliminates their individual identities. In both of the earlier depictions, it is easy to tell the soldiers apart. The soldiers next to Kearney in Tholey’s painting may be wearing identical clothing, but they are not alike. On the other hand, all the soldiers in Nevinson’s drawing look the same. Indeed, they are so similar that they begin to blend into one another. From their strides to their helmets, they merge into a single mass of flesh, so conjoined that it is hard to discern where one figure ends and the next begins. 
	<p>
	Returning to the Trenches, like many of Nevinson’s other works, including La Mitrailleuse and French Troops Resting, embodies the idea that warfare was becoming less spontaneous and more mechanized. In Returning to the Trenches, the soldiers are reduced to automatons lacking any personality. Likewise, La Mitrailleuse illustrates a soldier in the same gray tones and sharp angles as the machine gun he is holding, hence the name “La Mitrailleuse” (machine gun). To quote Michael Walsh, “humanity … is reduced to a mere facet of the military machine, and is stripped of sentiment as its own inertia carried it toward the murderous task ahead and indeed to its own destruction” (Walsh 188). 
	<p>
	On The Firing Line, painted by Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin in 1916, reveals how the effect of technology was felt even in its absence. Petrov-Vodkin’s portrayal, showing Russian soldiers charging up a hill, is more conventional than Nevinson’s. The most advanced weapons in the painting are rifles and swords, but even without machine guns and artillery, the soldiers have not escaped their reach. The soldiers, eyes unnaturally wide open and unblinking, appear as if they are in a menacing trance. With their emotionless, blank stares, their faces exhibit characteristics more reminiscent of machines than people.
	<p>
	Indeed, perhaps the most striking paintings about the impact of technology were those without any technology at all, or people, for that matter. In his 1918 painting We Are Making a New World, free of any machine or man, Paul Nash elucidated the tremendous new power of modern technology when employed for destruction rather than production. The unusual curved landscape and the disfigured tree stumps strewn across it are a testament to the unparalleled destructive capability armies now had at their disposal. The “explicitly apocalyptic” imagery insinuates “the end of a familiar world of social ordering, landscape and technology” in which warfare was a defining institution (Tolson 527). By the end of the conflict, Nash’s painting suggests, the world was so devastated by war that there was hardly anything worth fighting for. 
	<p>
	At its root, the mechanization of warfare represented a shift in the relationship between war and nature from harmony to conflict. Earlier paintings such as Tholey’s show nature and war proceeding in sync. Indeed, throughout the 18th and 19th centuries snipers and skirmishers frequently took advantage of trees and vegetation to enhance their position in battle. Nash’s painting frames war and nature as opponents, however. With the advent of technology, nature no longer served as an asset to warfare. 
	<p>
	Barbaric portrayals of warfare were not new. A century before world war one, the Spanish artist Francisco Goya created a series of prints — appropriately named The Disasters of War — depicting the inhumanity of war. The Third of May 1808, for instance, painted in 1814, illustrates in crude realism the Spanish resistance against Napoleon during the Peninsular War. French soldiers are shown holding Spanish partisans at gunpoint, and multiple lifeless bodies lie bleeding on the ground. Execution was a recurring theme in Goya’s drawings, whether it came in the form of beheadings (The Same) or crucifixions (For a clasp knife). 
	<p>
	Neither the Napoleonic wars nor the artwork they spawned produced a genuine anti-war movement, however. On the contrary, warfare in the century preceding world war one became increasingly codified. Several international agreements between 1859 and 1907 made official the distinction between crime and war, the latter being “waged by sovereign states and them alone” (Creveld 40). Soldiers were “strictly isolated from society at large” and required to obtain a license, wear uniforms at all times, and display their arms openly while on duty (Creveld 40). War was a state-sanctioned activity, regulated as any other.  
	<p>
	Technology was the primary catalyst behind the transformation of war. The emergence of trench warfare on the Western front coincided with the demise of the infamous “cult of the offensive,” which had engendered the association of warfare with patriotism and courage (Black 23). For the first time, the combination of trenches, machine guns, artillery, and rifles made defensive positions so impregnable that war ground to a halt (Stevenson 149). With no room for decisive maneuvers, the war descended into a deadlock in which the brave, bold assaults of earlier conflicts were replaced by an insipid waiting game. As the British veteran Montgomery Belgion put it, “in World War I the real heroism, the true greatness of the soldier, was shown … not in his daring, not in his bravery on occasion, but in his steady endurance” (Panichas 306). 
	<p>
	There is surely a correlation between the magnitude of technology’s role in war and dehumanization. An increase in machinery and a decrease in mêlée occurred simultaneously. Richard Jack’s 1919 painting The Taking of Vimy Ridge exposes the reality of world war one warfare: from the perspective of artillery, the enemy is practically imperceptible. Aside from the eruption and smoke as shell meets earth, individual soldiers are impossible to discern. Equally illuminating is the ratio of soldier to machine: based on Jack’s painting, five men are required to operate a single unit of artillery, and the cannon is larger than any single one of them.
	<p>
	Other paintings, such as The Grenade by Norwegian artist Per Krohg, also diminish soldiers as secondary to machines. The Grenade, painted in 1916, depicts four soldiers navigating a trench while grenades explode and bullets fly overhead. Proportionally, the size of the explosion makes the soldiers look like ants by comparison, crawling underfoot in the dirt as the machines function on a higher plane. When hand-to-hand combat did occur, and the soldiers were center stage, it had none of the positive connotations of the past. Encounter in the Darkness, painted in 1919 by the American veteran Claggett Wilson, portrays a struggle between the silhouettes of two soldiers. Their humanity stripped away, only their shadows remain. 
	<p>
	As a matter of fact, technology did not eliminate camaraderie between opponents. Throughout the war, there was a prevailing sense of “live and let live” on the Western Front, by which soldiers and their opponents exercised mutual restraint (Shaw 624). By the end of the war, civilians were sometimes more pugnacious than the soldiers themselves. To quote psychologist Robert Sapolsky, “the further from the front, the more hostility” (C2). 
	<p>
	Rather, the enemy became amorphous: for the civilians, it was usually the other side’s soldiers. For the soldiers, it might be the soldiers in the opposing trench; their own generals and politicians; the opposing generals; or themselves. “Just who or what constituted the enemy differed from artist to artist” (Cozzolino 41). Paintings from world war one, in stark contrast with those from the American Civil War and the Sino-Japanese War, saw the demise of war clearly defined in terms of black and white. 
	<p>
	Technology also contributed to the lack of a heroic military leader during the war. Despite an abundance of powerful generals and statesmen — from Pershing to Lloyd George to Ludendorff to Joffre — no Napoleonic or Washingtonian figure emerged from the first world war (Axelrod 165). There were certainly generals, like France’s Philippe Pétain, who served with great distinction; but there were few commanders behaving with the audacity and the ingenuity of Napoleon or Washington. 
	<p>
	The implications for art are straightforward; it is hard to paint a portrait like Tholey’s of Kearney when such an event rarely occurred. The static nature of war did not just mean a decline in the glamor of warfare for the soldiers; it also meant fewer opportunities for the generals to display their valor on the battlefield. Even the German generals like Ludendorff and Falkenhayn, who led arguably the finest army in Europe in 1914, tended to play the role of strategist rather than the role of warrior. 
	<p>
	There were exceptions. Just as realistic wartime art existed before world war one, romanticized wartime art continued to be produced afterward. Of the latter, the most notable case in the first world war derived from aerial warfare. Fighting Aces of War Skies, painted by Rudolph Belarski in 1934, for example, retains much of the elegance of pre-war artwork. Depicting the famous German “flying circus,” Belarski’s painting reanimates the bright colors that characterized the prints from the Sino-Japanese War as well as the neat formations of earlier wars. Furthermore, the patriotism of past paintings survives in the form of insignia on each airplane’s fuselage and rudder.
	<p>
	Illustrations of dogfights were the closest world war one artists came to reviving the thrill and fervor of old-fashioned warfare. The British poet Henry Newbolt, writing in 1916, summarized the impression well: “our airmen are singularly like the knights of the old romances; they go out day by day, singly or in twos and threes, to hold the field against all comers” (Robertson 159). If the battlefields of the Western Front produced any national heroes, they were the pilots: Eddie Rickenbacker, Manfred von Richthofen, and Billy Bishop, to name a few. Their measurement of success, the number of enemy aircraft shot down, also harkens back to an era in which killings were tallied as a point of pride (Robertson 160).
	<p>
	Ultimately, though, the air force was relegated to an ancillary role in the war. In world war one, the chief purpose of aircraft was to aid artillery through reconnaissance, not to attack the enemy (Stevenson 154). Featuring primitive vehicles and inexperienced pilots, the air war remained inchoate and anyhow, the days of airborne knights duking it out in the sky were short-lived (Beckett 257). 
	<p>
	“This is not war,” an Indian soldier on the Western Front wrote in 1915. “It is the ending of the world” (Black 46).The first world war marked the end of warfare as an established institution. Ironically, up to that point in history “hardly any human activity ha[d] been so formalized, hierarchalized, and organized as war” (Meisel 182). In the war’s aftermath, the belligerents convened again — but this time to legislate peace, not war. “War, in itself and for itself, is the greatest crime in the world, and the glory of victory, pursued for itself, is a crime,” Supreme Allied Commander Ferdinand Foch declared in 1921 (American Peace Society 366). 
	<p>
	In an incredible turn of events, one of the most prominent soldiers of the war now believed “that the abolition of war [was] an attainable ideal” (American Peace Society 366). For the first time, the international community came together to found an organization — the League of Nations — whose cornerstone would be peaceful resolution of disputes through mediation. From world war one onward, civilized warfare, the art of war, became just that: art, which lives on in pictures.
